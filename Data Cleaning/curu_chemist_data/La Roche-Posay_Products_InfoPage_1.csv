TEXTURE The Cicaplast B5 Repair Serum Is: • 	Lightweight • 	Fast absorbing • 	Non-sticky finish • 	Silky and Non-greasy texture Please note, the skin repair serum forms a protective film on the skin upon application, however, can ensure a non-sticky lightweight feel to the skin. KEY INGREDIENTS Repairing - 10% Vitamin B5 - Also known as Panthenol, Vitamin B5 is a humectant that attracts moisture from its surroundings and is able to lock in moisture within the skin. Vitamin B5 for skin is used to help support and maintain the skin moisture barrier. Due to its capability to attract and retain moisture, using Vitamin B5 helps soften skin, keeping it moist and helps prevent dryness. Vitamin B5 supports the skin moisture barrier through hydration, and reduces trans-epidermal water loss (TEWL), helping to reduce dryness and associated itchiness and discomfort. 10% Vitamin B5 has been added to the repair serum formula to hydrate and repair dry sensitive skin. Refining - HEPES - HEPES helps to gently exfoliate dead skin cells that are bound to the surface of the skin, refining clogged pores and uneven texture resulting in a smoother skin texture. HEPES has been used in the formulation to help even skin tone and refine skin texture. Soothing - Aqua Posae Filiformis (APF) - This prebiotic skincare is used to help rebalance the skin microbiome.
