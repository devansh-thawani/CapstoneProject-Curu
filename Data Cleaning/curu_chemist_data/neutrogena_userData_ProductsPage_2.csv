0,Neutrogena Hydro Boost Hyaluronic Acid Water Gel 50g,Kris,Very happy to find this product I live in Phuket and can’t use much on my skin due to the humidity. This is perfect as it absorbs so quickly and cools the skin I will be taking plenty back with me,5 out of 5 stars.
1,Neutrogena Hydro Boost Hyaluronic Acid Water Gel 50g,Ali L,"Love this stuff, it’s the best moisturiser I’ve found to use during summer when you don’t want to use heavy creams during hot, humid weather. It’s light, hydrating and one jar lasts several months even with daily use.",5 out of 5 stars.

4,Neutrogena Hydro Boost Hyaluronic Acid Water Gel 50g,DediL6,Hydrogel is continuously approved by dermatologists for all skin types. I love this moisturiser because you're regardless to how my skin is feeling before it goes on he doesn't feel like it's covered with a slick layer of oil. It really does feel light as water and it applies like a light cream.,5 out of 5 stars.
5,Neutrogena Hydro Boost Hyaluronic Acid Water Gel 50g,Yasmin,I have been buying this gel for 6 months now and it is by far the best product I have used to give my skin the hydration it needs without irritation and my 17 yr old boy uses it every day as well…. Smells great and very refreshing in the skin highly recommend,5 out of 5 stars.
6,Neutrogena Hydro Boost Hyaluronic Acid Water Gel 50g,TTTL303,"I recently tried the Neutrogena Hydro Boost Hyaluronic Acid Water Gel Refill Pod, and I must say, it's a fantastic addition to the original product. As someone who appreciates eco-friendly options and looks for ways to reduce waste, the refill pod option caught my attention. The refill pod itself is easy to use. It comes in a compact, sealed package that keeps the product fresh until you're ready to refill your jar. To refill, you simply twist off the empty jar's lid, remove the protective seal on the refill pod, and place it inside the jar. The pod fits perfectly and smoothly dispenses the product into the jar.",5 out of 5 stars.
7,Neutrogena Hydro Boost Hyaluronic Acid Water Gel 50g,TTTL303,"The texture of the gel is lightweight and refreshing, which makes it a joy to apply. It glides smoothly onto the skin and absorbs quickly without leaving any residue. The gel consistency feels cooling on the skin, providing an instant burst of hydration. I found that a small amount of product was sufficient to cover my entire face, making the jar last for a long time. What I love about this product is its versatility. It works well as both a day and night moisturizer. During the day, it provides a smooth base for makeup application and doesn't interfere with the wear of foundation or other products. At night, it helps to replenish moisture and leaves my skin feeling rejuvenated by the morning.",5 out of 5 stars.
8,Neutrogena Hydro Boost Hyaluronic Acid Water Gel 50g,Nancy,I bought this a month ago and my skin feels so much softer and brighter,5 out of 5 stars.
9,Neutrogena Hydro Boost Hyaluronic Acid Water Gel 50g,EmmaK7,This is my absolute go to moisturiser and I use it daily. I’ve repurchased over 4 times now and it’s so great that it comes in refills rather than repurchasing the whole jar. It’s super lightweight so perfect for morning/daytime use.,5 out of 5 stars.
10,Neutrogena Hydro Boost Hyaluronic Acid Water Gel 50g,Louise5,"This is my holt grail moisturiser for all year round, and when they came out with the refill option I was SO excited. It is so great to see a brand be more conscious about consumer recycling.",5 out of 5 stars.
11,Neutrogena Hydro Boost Hyaluronic Acid Water Gel 50g,Nikki232,"I freaking honestly LOVE this! I have combination skin but a lot of moisturisers are just that bit too much for it and make it super oily, this is amazing. I bought this to try as I was simply looking for a moisturiser to go underneath a new makeup (that doesn’t blend well over a lot of moisturisers I’ve used) and not only is it a winner there but it has worked wonders for my skin since I started 2wks ago, it actually looks smoother, younger and is most definitely softer to touch, I also haven’t had any breakouts. The cream is such a light, smooth feel, almost reminds me of summer. A little goes a long way so although it may be a little pricey (at full price) it really works out quite cheap in the long run as it will last ages.Thank you SO MUCH Neutrogena.Highly Highly Recommend 1000%",5 out of 5 stars.

31,Neutrogena Hydro Boost Hyaluronic Acid Water Gel 50g,Steph13,"[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] What a game changer! This is an outstanding product to provide a level of hydration to your face that most brands I've tried in the past lack. Using this nightly, I could feel a dramatic difference each morning. My skin is typically a combination of oily and dry and this helped my skin feel plump and hydrating without feeling oily and breaking out. Most gels in the past have caused my skin to breakout however this product still felt very natural and comfortable on the skin. It was easy to wear each night and a product that I will continue to use.  My skin texture and overall moisture levels have increased significantly since trying this product and I am overall SO happy with my results.",5 out of 5 stars.

66,Neutrogena Hydro Boost Hyaluronic Acid Water Gel 50g,Aetain,"I have combination skin, don't wear make up, and never had many problems with it until I started working in an office with amped up air-conditioning. For reference, I have a blanket and wheat bag in my drawer, and an actual heater under my desk it gets so cold, especially in summer. It really dried out my skin, which caused my T zone to go into overdrive producing oil while my cheeks got really flakey, and I had breakouts all over my chin, jawline, neck and forehead. I never got breakouts, even when I was going through puberty, so this was totally new territory for me in my late 20s. I'd never had a skin routine because I never needed one, I literally just washed with water in the shower and occasionally used a face scrub.After trying many moisturizers over the last 3 years (both cheap and expensive) and finding they'd usually make my skin worse, I got this on a whim about 2 months ago and it's been a dream from day one. Within 24 hours, my latest breakout was clearly smaller, totally cleared up within a week, and I haven't had a single breakout since. My skin stays matte all day, no oilyness, no dryness, no breakouts, it's perfect. It's even helped with the black, puffy circles under my eyes from late night gaming sessions. I've been getting heaps of compliments about my skin from coworkers as well which has been a nice change from ""Oh, that looks painful!"" and unwanted advice when they'd notice a big pimple.",5 out of 5 stars.

114,Neutrogena Hydro Boost Hyaluronic Acid Water Gel 50g,Brerobb2,"[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] When I first applied the Hyaluronic Acid Water Gel to my face, I was surprised at how light it felt. The cream itself is smooth and feels cool on the skin. The directions recommend to apply as necessary throughout the day to boost hydration in the skin, but I only reapplied once per day at the most as I didn’t feel my skin was drying out quickly. The hydration certainly lasted! My only disappointment was the moisturiser had no SPF rating, and being a Queenslander that means applying sunscreen over the top of moisturisers when you are out and about, which can minimise the effectiveness. But this is only a minor downfall as the product feels so beautiful on!",4 out of 5 stars.

As soon as I put some on my fingers I smelt the mild fragrance which was very pleasant. I applied it to my entire face, forehead and neck. My forehead in particular can be noticeably quite dry and normally takes quite a thick layer of moisturiser to really penetrate into the dry spots.

181,Neutrogena Hydro Boost Hyaluronic Acid Serum 30mL,yk92c8,[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Love this product. I had heard a lot about hyalouronic acid previously but never felt the urge to buy a separate hyalouronic acid as a lot of the other products I use include it as an ingredient. I’m so glad I got to try this out though because it has made a huge difference to my skin. I use it nightly straight after cleansing and before my treatment and moisturiser. I have found that when I wake up in the morning my skin has a natural glow to it without being oily. I feel like it has also helped reduce my acne breakouts in combination with other products I use. I will definitely be purchasing this product when I run out.,5 out of 5 stars.

Suitable for people who like their products fragrance-free. It has a dropper system like that we see in oil items where button has to be pushed from top.

Other than that it is good.",4 out of 5 stars.

203,Neutrogena Hydro Boost Hyaluronic Acid Serum 30mL,liana_tries_makeup,"[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] This serum provided a noticeable boost in hydration in my skin. The dropper is actually one of the best I’ve seen, with a push type dropper to get the product rather than a pinch dropper, which gets huge points for me. I wasn’t the biggest fan of the little beads in the product. When spreading it on the face, they did disappear but they made my overall experience less favourable. Ultimately I was quite impressed though and found that the product soaks in quite quickly.",4 out of 5 stars.

207,Neutrogena Hydro Boost Hyaluronic Acid Serum 30mL,katyd48,"[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Much like how I felt with the foaming cleanser, looking at the ingredients they’re quite good for an affordable line of skincare products. I always look at how many actives and ingredients are in over the counter, affordable products to determine their efficacy, and found this not too bad to use! I think this would be a great introduction to those new to skincare, especially if you can find it on sale! Hyaluronic acid is a great way to keep the skin hydrated by keeping water in the skin. One point is I found the distribution of the little dissolvable beads unnecessary but cute to look at. Ha. I think this is great if you keep your face damp after your cleanse, and tap this in. The only difficulty is getting the beads to break down and I’d recommend doing this in your palm ✋ before you apply so you can tap it gently around your face, neck etc. It’s not really for me, as I’m quite particular in my skincare selection but did give it a go for the sake of a review. I’d recommend this for skincare newbies, teens for acne control and dehydration and certainly when on sales it’s effective in cost! I think for the price point, however , there are more effective HA serums that are larger in size and can work more effectively as there’s no need for fragrance additives and a lot of the added ingredients (preservatives) that I would suggest first. I ended up giving this to my husband and slowly starting to get him used to different forms of skincare as we’re in our 30s and he’s the typical male who knows nothing about it haha so because he has ezcema, we found when he flared up, this was a big no no (as I wouldn’t recommend an acid of any kind during ezcema flare ups). I then gave some of this to my male friend to use as he has oilyresilient skin and he’s quite fond of it. So I really think this is one of those lines that you can appreciate what they’re doing since skincare has really boomed with the gen z population, but would i gift it to anyone who uses skincare already? No.",3 out of 5 stars.

But the real magic happened when I opened it to smell the soft, caressing, fresh scent!  I was a little concerned the oil would be too heavy on my combo skin, as I haven't had much success with other oils, but was very impressed when it took seconds to absorb, and there was no residue on the tissue I pressed onto my cheek!  I have used it morning, noon and night to get a really good feel for it, as it arrived very late in the project, and am very happy with the satin smooth finish it leaves on my face, neck and decolletage.  An added bonus is the improvement to the back of my hands, so from now on this oil is going to sit on my bedside table to bring them back to life again!  It will definitely be added to my skincare regime, and replace a few mediocre products that don't give anywhere near the same results after only a short period of time!

266,Neutrogena Rapid Wrinkle Repair Retinol Oil 30ml,Kay0351,"[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] With my skin starting to age, I am very conscious of the wrinkles appearing and how deep my forehead lines and crows feet lines are. After more than 2 weeks of daily usage (some days twice daily), I have noticed a huge visible improvement in my crows feet lines, almost to the point they are nearly gone! A little tub of miracle oil this Neutrogena Rapid Wrinkle Repair Retinol Oil is. My forehead lines have also visibly improved. The oil is smooth to apply, smells nice and soaks in well to the skin - leaving a positive lasting impression. I did find I had to apply quite a bit of the oil to soak in enough to my skin, but I do suffer from dry skin so that's most products. I found I needed to apply liberally for my skin to feel moisturised but I did notice the difference if I didn't apply the oil - my skin was a lot drier without it. I absolutely would recommend this product.",4 out of 5 stars.

I’m sure over time that will mean softer lines and wrinkles too.",4 out of 5 stars.
275,Neutrogena Rapid Wrinkle Repair Retinol Oil 30ml,Anonymous,"[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] This is a lovely oil to use - it absorbs and doesn't leave my oily, acne-prone skin feeling greasy. I also feel this is a gentle way to incorporate retinol into your routine as it didn't cause any irritation. It's a ""dry oil"" so it doesn't feel oily after application. I apply this at night, but I believe this can also be applied in the morning, under sunscreen, as it provides a really nice finish.My only comment is that the fragrance wasn't my cup of tea. It sort of reminds me of dishwashing fragrance. Luckily it doesn't linger for too long, but I would have preferred a fragrance-free option, or one with essential oils instead which are more agreeable.",4 out of 5 stars.

292,Neutrogena Rapid Wrinkle Repair Retinol Oil 30ml,Magdab2,"[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] This is a lovely rich oil with a solid dose of retinol, which has, in some tests, shown an increase in the production of collagen and stimulation of new blood vessels in the skin.  I found that it absorbed very quickly and easily, and didn’t leave a greasy film.  I used this only at night but I imagine that you could easily put makeup on over it if you wanted.  I didn’t need a moisturiser afterwards as it left my skin very soft and hydrated, but if your skin is super dry, you could put on your usual moisturiser straight on top.  Scent was light and not overpowering, and I didn’t experience any redness or itchiness over the period of a week, which is actually unusual for me as I have sensitive skin.  I do think I’ve noticed a small (it has only been a week!) decrease in fine lines between my eyebrow and around my eyes and my skin seems a bit brighter and fresher.  Will continue to use this for ongoing benefits.",4 out of 5 stars.

296,Neutrogena Rapid Wrinkle Repair Retinol Oil 30ml,Justyeux,"I bought this thinking it was an oil, but it doesn’t actually contain any, it’s more the formula that makes it an oil like consistency so there should be no pore clogging issues. I’ve been using retinol for over 6 years so I had zero irritation when layering this underneath other retinol products, with that being said this doesn’t actually state what retinol percentage it contains. This product also has an unnecessary amount of fragrance in It so be warned. I like the idea of the product but would not repurchase because of the amount of fragrance.",4 out of 5 stars.

299,Neutrogena Rapid Wrinkle Repair Retinol Oil 30ml,anggg96,[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Wasn't a huge fan of the Neutrogena voxbox. I tried all the products a few times but I didn't feel like the products were anything special but they also didn't irritate my skin. The packaging was nice. Overall I give it 5/10,3 out of 5 stars.
300,Neutrogena Rapid Wrinkle Repair Retinol Oil 30ml,victoriac338,"[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Initial thoughts is that the fragrance is quite strong and might be a bit too much for some people.. the retinol content is also quite low at 0.3% (I currently use 1%). The product is oil based so i have been using as a facial oil (on my non-retinol nights) and feels rather pleasant on my skin and not too oily.The box says that it should be used morning and night but I would NOT recommend using in the morning, as sun exposure with retinol can be damaging to skin.Overall, it's not a bad product since it doubles as a facial oil but I think if you invest a bit more you can get a more effective retinol product.",3 out of 5 stars.
301,Neutrogena Rapid Wrinkle Repair Retinol Oil 30ml,Kate10,"I think this product is great for anyone looking to add retinol to their routine.

303,Neutrogena Rapid Wrinkle Repair Retinol Oil 30ml,Rossy1,"[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] The smell of the product is quite strong but not unpleasant, however, it could be milder. The feel of the oil is not too oily and it absorbs reasonably quickly. It did tingle on my face the first time I used it, and there were bits on my face after application (almost like a bit of peeling). After 2 weeks of using it, I wouldn't say my wrinkles have improved drastically. The product claims to reduce the appearance of dark spots and my spot is marginally lighter. It is very nourishing for my skin though, so that is a big positive. I will continue to use it to see if the dark spot lightens even more.",3 out of 5 stars.
304,Neutrogena Rapid Wrinkle Repair Retinol Oil 30ml,Julie3,[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I have only been using the product for 2 nights so far but wake up in the morning minus the bags under my eyes. The wrinkles are less and I look fresher.The product disclosure states that results may vary and are more noticeable after 4 weeks but I have already seen a change.Best thing is there has been no side effects as indicated on the box.,3 out of 5 stars.
305,Neutrogena Rapid Wrinkle Repair Retinol Oil 30ml,Emma758634568,This is the worst dropper i have ever experienced.Using this with oily hands is impossible not to mention it drips out and doesn't hold the oil in.Nice enough product but please rethink the packaging for the dropper!,2 out of 5 stars.

345,Neutrogena Advanced Acne Cleanser 150ml,affysbestofbeauty,"[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I received this cleanser complimentary Neutrogena® Advanced Acne Cleanser 150ml from @influenster in exchange for my honest opinions. I’ve been using it for around a few weeks now and here are my thoughts:Formulated with a blend of exfoliating ingredients (4.5% AHA/PHA/Salicylic Acid), this gel-like cleanser helps reduce blemishes and improves uneven texture. It does contain some fragrance which might be sensitising for some people. However, it doesn’t irritate my skin as long as I’m not leaving it on skin for longer than 20-30 secs. Having said that, the cleanser is a bit stripping but if you have oily/acne-prone skin - it may work out wonderfully for your skin.Overall, this cleanser is worth-trying if you suffer from clogged pores & acne. The ingredients are impressive except the fragrance component. I would have enjoyed it more only if it was “unscented”.",4 out of 5 stars.

Unlike other products I've tried these products don't stain or bleach my towels or clothes. Also, they seem to prevent the acne from coming. Usually products work on getting rid of a pimple which is fine but when they constantly popping up prevention is definitely key.

I was already using another cleanser a couple times a week, but I added this twice daily, and it's been amazing! You don't need much product at all, so it's lasting me quite some time. The instructions say to apply to wet face before lathering, but I found it didn't really foam up much, so I lathered it up on my hands and it was much better! The scent is typical Neutrogena scent, which isn't great, but it's tolerable. Retail price isn't awful, considering just how much product you actually get.

I would reuse and repurchase in a pinch but I have used ones I prefer more, I think the only thing about this one that I don’t love which is a personal thing is it sort of feels like it’s on the skin unless I use a cloth to wash my face afterwards.

514,Neutrogena Deep Clean Gentle Foaming Cleanser 175g,jessiesworld_,"[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I'll be brutally honest; I found this cleanser to be very average. It didn't really foam, more of a lather. And it wasn't enough to remove makeup or clean the skin thoroughly after one cleanse. It does state it's a gentle cleanser for sensitive skin so perhaps it was just too gentle for me, but may be great for those with truly sensitive skin. You also get a lot of product and the price point is affordable. It just wasn't for me unfortunately.",2 out of 5 stars.

The 14g jar of product looks expensive, the cream itself is luscious, it's honestly what you'd expect from a high end eye cream. A little product goes a long way so it'll definitely last a while also. The product is meant to be fragrance free but I feel as if there is a very slight smell to the cream, nothing over powering and the smell fades very quickly. I would suggest patch testing this cream under your chin a minimum of 48 hours prior to use especially if your skin isn't used to active ingredients. You will feel a slight tingle but that just means the product is doing exactly as intended. Very impressed & I can honestly say I would repurchase this eye cream.",5 out of 5 stars.

660,Neutrogena Rapid Wrinkle Repair Retinol Pro+ Eye Cream 14g,Bennie8,"[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I like the texture of the eye cream as it's a little thicker than ones I have used.  Due to the consistency, I found it was more hydrating around the eye area which in turn gave the appearance of less lines and less dehydration.  The cream feels cooling around the eye area.  I have been using this for just over two weeks and like how it feels and makes my skin look.  The eye area appears smoother and definitely softer.It does have a subtle scent, more of a chemical scent but that doesn't transfer onto the face.  I can only smell it in the jar.I personally don't suffer from too much dark circles under the eye area and I haven't seem a difference with that but like any skincare it takes time to see that type of results.I am in my 40s so something like this is exactly what my skin needs.  I like this eye cream and will continue to use to and possibly repurchase.",4 out of 5 stars.

This eye cream has retinol that speeds up cell replenishment and effectively remived fine lines, wrinkles, and crow’s feet.

668,Neutrogena Fragrance Free Extra Gentle Cleanser 200mL,Stacey1,"I was recommended this cleanser by a dermatologist a long time ago and now make sure I always have one in the cupboard for times when my skin gets reactive or my barrier is stripped. I have tried much more expensive gentle cleansers and this one is just as good. I go through patches where my skin get irritated by everything and allergic, and this is what I then use. For a long time any cleanser I used would cause me to break out and this is the only one that didn't. It doesn't leave your skin feeling dry, but also doesn't give you a really clean feeling. If you are wearing makeup or sunscreen you would definitely need to remove it first or at least double cleanse because I don't feel like this does as good a cleanse as other cleansers. If your barrier is stripped it can sometimes feel a little burny but that's because of my skin not the cleanser. Would really recommend this if you have sensitive, irritable skin.",5 out of 5 stars.

694,Neutrogena Fragrance Free Extra Gentle Cleanser 200mL,Stephye8,"[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I love using cream cleanser in my morning routine as it is not overly drying for my skin. Neutrogena Extra Gentle Cleanser is not a cream cleanser but it does have a gel-cream consistency which is fine to me. It is fragrance free and smells like glycerin (then again, it's one of the ingredients in the cleanser). It cleanses my skin without leaving it dry nor leaves any moisturizing residue that some cream cleanser may leave. As for night routine, i'll usually double cleanse, starting with an oil makeup remover to remove my makeup/ sunscreen followed by this cleanser and it still cleans my skin nicely with no noticeable makeup residue. Overall, this is a pretty cool product for sensitive/ dry skin and i am in love with it.",5 out of 5 stars.

I tried the Naturals Purifying Cream Cleanser but am bothered by the tingling sensation around my eye areas.Once I find a good facial skin care product, I usually stick to it.

748,Neutrogena Fragrance Free Extra Gentle Cleanser 200mL,Sher,"Let me start by saying that I am generally a cosmetic/beauty product snob. Unless I am in a pinch, I do not use drugstore brands. That being said, this is the absolute best cleanser I have ever used for my fair, sensitive skin that is prone to dryness. I have used so many other specialty and high end brands and none of them have been as good. This has never left my skin irritated. It always feels soft and moisturized and never tight. I have used enough beauty products in my life to know that the tight feeling that people equate to cleanliness is not necessary. When I use this cleaner my skin looks youthful and free from fine lines. My only concern is my inability to find this anymore. None of my local drugstores or grocery stores ever have it. They only ever have the Ultra Gentle Cleanser which is not at all what I want. If I am out of town and I see it, I will literally buy every single one the store has.

749,Neutrogena Fragrance Free Extra Gentle Cleanser 200mL,vancity,"I switched to this cleanser when I realized my old ""organic gentle acne cleanser"" had menthol and added fragrances in it. Menthol is an irritant but is added to products so you get that fresh tingly feeling, which is more likely due to subtle inflammation than being ""fresh and clean"". I also decided that I didn't want anything in my cleanser that had ""added benefits"". This might sound contradictory but I just wanted a cleanser that cleaned in the most gentle effective way possible; I get the benefits of vitamins and anti-oxidants from my toner and moisturizers that don't get washed down the drain.It was an interesting switch at the start, as my face didn't have that usual tingle/tight feeling BUT it was still SO clean and fresh! My skin is definitely feeling healthier, and looks great. This cleanser will be a keeper!",5 out of 5 stars.

This product is very gentle and doesn't burn or sting my eyes.My morning routine: splash water on my face, apply this & rinse off with water. While my face is still wet, I use the Neutrogena Deep Clean Gentle Scrub to exfoliate then I dry my face. I then use a face moisturizer (finishing a bottle that is currently open; then switching to a Neutrogena product). I wait 5 mins then apply Neutrogena's Ultra-Sheer Dry Touch SPF 45 Sunscreen, then let that absorb for 10-20 mins before applying makeup. Leaves my face super soft throughout the day, and greatly reduces the appearance of oil on my face (I have a very oily T-zone). Love that it reduces it! If your face is a bit shiny after the sunscreen, just dab on a bit of power :)Night routine: quickly remove makeup with a remover (just get what you can off), use this cleanser (removes the last of my lingering makeup, both eyes and face) + scrub, apply moisturizer, and go to bed!",5 out of 5 stars.

The first time I've used this gentle cleanser by Neutrogena I noticed an immediate difference in the way my skin felt. It was silky smooth and felt really clean.

831,Neutrogena Fragrance Free Extra Gentle Cleanser 200mL,Bryl108,"[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I have been suffering from an extremely dry face lately and this face cleanser has really improved my skin. After using it the first time I definitely noticed an improvement and I love the fact that it doesn’t have a scent. This face cleanser is very gentle on your skin and I would recommend it to anyone who suffers from dry skin on their face. I will definitely be purchasing this from now on instead of my clean & clear facial wash as it does not sting my face and actually moisturises it while cleansing so if you forget to moisturise your face after washing it, then it’s really not a big deal as the cleanser does both. I’m super glad I was chosen for this trial as I would have never thought about purchasing it and would probably still be struggling to find a gentle face cleanser for dry skin. The pump on the bottle is also extremely helpful that way it can’t leak out like ones with the lids tend to do.",4 out of 5 stars.

I had put it on and left it for a few seconds, and it started to irritate the sensitive skin around my eyes, lips, and nose. Also, just as a warning, this is a CREAM cleanser. At first I thought i had accidentally gotten a mousturizer. Overall, this is a good product but not exactly ""gentle'.",4 out of 5 stars.
849,Neutrogena Fragrance Free Extra Gentle Cleanser 200mL,noodles74,"I absolutely love how this performs with my skin cleansing brush. this cleanser does not dry or irritate my skin at all. the only bad thing is that it does not remove makeup well on its own, so you will probably need to use a separate makeup remover before you cleanse with this product",4 out of 5 stars.

It feels like I'm washing my face with a gentle milk-like lotion.It feels like the skin is not being thoroughly cleansed, but it is good for sensitive skin that can't handle drying ingredients in other cleansers.Since it is gentle and moisturizing, I wouldn't recommend this product for people who have acne issues. This product is probably best for mature skin and or skin that will be in cold climates.",4 out of 5 stars.

864,Neutrogena Fragrance Free Extra Gentle Cleanser 200mL,Gabriel,"I am so sick of companies that rid the consumer of perfectly fine products and then replace them with useless alternatives. The old formula had a proper lotion milky texture and was just beautiful, I could use it twice a day and it even removed a light full face of makeup. Could be rinsed/tissued/cotton padded off. A really gentle soothing formula for normal to dry to sensitive skins. The new formula is not at all creamy, it is more of a strange, thick, gel texture. I feel like I'm cleaning my face with hair gel. While it does rinse clean and can remove light make-up the old formula had this difference, it actually nourished the skin with good ingredients like chamomile etc. This new formula is void of anything helpful for skin, it is a cleanser nothing more. What's the point of changing the formula when this new formula already exists in new packaging in the US?  which I doubt we will ever receive here in Australia, where we pay more for cosmetic goods already? Very shady, Neutrogena need to inform their consumers when they are going to discontinue a product and not just hope we will like it. BRING BACK THE OLD FORMULA!",1 out of 5 stars.

I mostly use this mask at the end of those days when my skin felt very dry, or tired or a had a day when I did a complete make over . After cleansing my skin properly I use toner than I apply any night serum plus night cream in the end applying a layer of this at the end as the last layer so it locks all the moisture.Even for sensitive skin they cause no irritation.Highly recommended.",5 out of 5 stars.

I found it easy to apply and my skin absorbed it all.  I then put a little more on and found it made my skin wonderfully moisturised and soft. The cream is not greasy or heavy but a beautiful light cream that in the morning makes your skin look fresh and hydrated.  It does say it's one application but there is quite a large amount in the little container and I didn't put it all on in one night as it would have been too much and would most likely end up on my pillow and in my hair.,5 out of 5 stars.

887,Neutrogena Youthful Boost Smoothing Sleeping Mask 10mL,Denjas10,"[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] The mask comes in a cute capsule – kind of like a coffee pod – and you peel off the plastic before applying the mask to your face.Described as being a one-use pod, I discovered that there was plenty of the Sleeping Mask formula in the container, giving me the opportunity to try it on multiple occasions. Would love to see a resealable function to allow for maximum freshness of the product if used over a few days.I woke up to skin that felt smoother, softer and more supple. I found it best (I used this a couple of times over 3 nights)  allow the Sleeping Mask to absorb for a few minutes before bed, otherwise it may stain your pillow. you could  lay down a towel over your pillowcase if you wish to do so.

I think the idea of a single use mask is a bit of a stretch...I have got about 6 uses out of this small pot...and at around $4 it's definitely a great buy!

I use a lot of skin products from cleansers, masks, etc and know that for real results from a product you need to use it for at least 3 months. I’m also skeptical of the Benifit of HA as a topical application, but there must be something about combining Shea and HA because I could be seen and feel the difference the next day. My skin was softer, and just looked better hydrated and nourished. I’m going to start including this in my daily skin routine.

The application can be a little difficult and messy but try spreading the mask out evenly so it dries quicker and don’t leave it on too long after its set.",4 out of 5 stars.
920,Neutrogena Deep Clean Purifying Peel Off Mask 10g,Trudes7,"[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I dont think there was anything particularly amazing about it, it smelt really good and came off nicely. If its a cheaper option than brands than i would consider buying it.",4 out of 5 stars.
921,Neutrogena Deep Clean Purifying Peel Off Mask 10g,Rachii8,"[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] The prodcut worked really well, felt refreshed and clean afterwards. Would probably buy again.",4 out of 5 stars.
922,Neutrogena Deep Clean Purifying Peel Off Mask 10g,Sophie1,[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] It made my skin soft and clean. However I still had blackheads. Maybe a stronger product is needed for blackheads,4 out of 5 stars.
923,Neutrogena Deep Clean Purifying Peel Off Mask 10g,cmpsuess4,"[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Well, first off I absolutely loved the colour of the mask, seafoam green just made me want to relax. The smell was great! It took alot longer to dry than anticipated but peeled off easily when it was dry. My skin did feel moisturised but wasn't long lasting. But definitely a step up from some others I have tried.",4 out of 5 stars.
924,Neutrogena Deep Clean Purifying Peel Off Mask 10g,Jessicar937,"[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I thought, as a mask, it was fantastic. It smelt nice and made my skin feel fantastic afterwards. I feel they could benefit better by having it in a bottle/tube rather than a packet like what we received as it was hard to get it all out and I don’t think I had enough to properly apply it to my face. In general it was fantastic and I’ll probably buy it again.",4 out of 5 stars.
925,Neutrogena Deep Clean Purifying Peel Off Mask 10g,Hellobunny8,"[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] The mask was fairly easy to apply, it is a thick consistency and takes a bit of care to apply to the entire face. The product itself smells really nice and it was easy to peel off. My skin felt really clean afterwards.",4 out of 5 stars.
926,Neutrogena Deep Clean Purifying Peel Off Mask 10g,Milly4,[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Skin felt super smooth after. Felt a bit weird peeling it off.,4 out of 5 stars.
927,Neutrogena Deep Clean Purifying Peel Off Mask 10g,Sweksha3,"[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] My skin ia oily, thus this mask is perfect for my skin, It made my skin so smooth and fresh. Peeling off the mask is gentle too.",4 out of 5 stars.
928,Neutrogena Deep Clean Purifying Peel Off Mask 10g,Tarni,"I wasn’t expecting miracles and I was not disappointed, it’s very much like any other peel off mask, I was hoping for a harder set but it was really easy to remove and my skin felt ok after. Whilst it was a nice mask, I think I prefer a stronger one. But I would recommend you try it for your self",4 out of 5 stars.
929,Neutrogena Deep Clean Purifying Peel Off Mask 10g,Sheree4,[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I was not a massive fan of the Neutrogena Purifying Boost Peel Off Mask my skin did feel really soft after but I found it dried it out!,3 out of 5 stars.
930,Neutrogena Deep Clean Purifying Peel Off Mask 10g,Sunshine6,[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Mask was quite difficult to apply - would work better in different packaging. The smell was pleasant but reasonably strong.  Took longer than the time specified to set. Pulling it off was a bit uncomfortable but did at least feel like it was doing it’s job. It did leave my skin feeling and looking smooth and soft. Left random little crusty bits of the mask on my face which was a bit annoying. Also was annoying to get off my sink where had it dripped trying to apply it. Overall I think it did make a positive difference to my skin but probably not enough that it was worth the time and effort.,3 out of 5 stars.
931,Neutrogena Deep Clean Purifying Peel Off Mask 10g,KayLeigh2,[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] It is a bit messy to apply. But it is quite unique and different to other masks that I have tried,3 out of 5 stars.
932,Neutrogena Deep Clean Purifying Peel Off Mask 10g,AnnieIsOk,I bought a couple of these masks as I love Neutrogena but the packaging design is absolutely horrible. Was so messy trying to scrape it out of the packet. The product itself wasn’t bad but not worth the trouble to get it out.,2 out of 5 stars.
933,Neutrogena Deep Clean Purifying Peel Off Mask 10g,Chloe10,"[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] The mask has a fun vibrant colour and strong fragrance. This may be an off putting factor for some skin care lovers who prefer natural unscented products. The mask left my skin feeling softer, however, took quite awhile to dry. I had to wait over 30 mins for it to dry, even then it still wasn't fully dry. It's an alright product but I wouldn't purchase it as they are better products in the market.",2 out of 5 stars.
934,Neutrogena Deep Clean Purifying Peel Off Mask 10g,nan8888,"it is like glue,sticky, spend one hour to take it off",1 out of 5 stars.
935,Neutrogena Purifying Boost Purifying Hydrogel Mask 30g,MimiMa,"I used one yesterday and using one right now. This mask has two different sides, one side sticks to my face nicely. i like the smell and overall experience. Will purchase more.",5 out of 5 stars.
936,Neutrogena Purifying Boost Purifying Hydrogel Mask 30g,YazVersace,I’ve purchased this face mask several times and it’s amazing especially before makeup application !!,4 out of 5 stars.
937,Neutrogena Purifying Boost Purifying Hydrogel Mask 30g,Rin88,"Ok product, left quite a lot of residue even the next morning, but otherwise did a good job",3 out of 5 stars.
938,Neutrogena Purifying Boost Purifying Hydrogel Mask 30g,BelindaJane,"The mask comes in two pieces which sounds good in theory, but not so much in practice. The mask just doesn't stick to the face very well. It's not shaped and cut to curve around the contours of the face. And the holes for eyes and mouth still have the flap of mask attached which weights it down even more. I know these masks are pretty cheap and it definitely shows in the design. I won't be buying them again",2 out of 5 stars.
939,Neutrogena Purifying Boost Purifying Hydrogel Mask 30g,neema,falls off your face easily,1 out of 5 stars.
