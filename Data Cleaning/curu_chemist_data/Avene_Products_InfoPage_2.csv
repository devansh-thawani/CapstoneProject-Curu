10,Avene A-Oxitive NIGHT Peeling Cream 30ml - Vitamin A moisturiser,"Avène A-Oxitive Night Peeling Cream works through the night to boost cellular activity, detoxify and even out skin texture, preserving youthful skin thanks to a night renewing complex of active ingredients.  Avène A-Oxitive Night Peeling Cream works through the night to boost cellular activity, detoxify and even out skin texture, preserving youthful skin thanks to a night renewing complex of active ingredients:
-	Gradual Release Vitamin A (Retinaldehyde): boosts cellular activity, refines the skin's texture and evens the skin tone. Reduces fine lines and wrinkles. 
-	Gradual Release Vitamin E (Pre-tocopheryl): fights against free radicals, powerful antioxidant
-	Evening primrose oil: sourced from the small seeds of the plant, commonly known as ""evening star"", whose flowers open only at dusk, rich in fatty acids and vitamins, helps nourish the skin and restore its balance
With powerful antioxidant properties, skin is protected against external aggressors including free radicals, revealing a visibly smoother, toned and more radiant complexion. Its fluid, creamy texture glides gently onto the skin, absorbing quickly for a non-greasy, velvety finish. By morning, fine lines and wrinkles are visibly reduced, skin texture is visibly refined, and pores are tightened.
Equivalent to 3 peel sessions*

Formulated to minimise the risk of allergic reaction, non-comedogenic, paraben free and fragrance free. Apply in the evening, after serum, to the face, neck and décolleté.
Not suitable for use while pregnant or breastfeeding. Avoid sun exposure and apply sunscreen daily.
