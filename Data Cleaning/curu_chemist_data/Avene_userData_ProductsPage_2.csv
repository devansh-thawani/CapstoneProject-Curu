It was never too serious, but it always came and go and I was never able to figure out the exact trigger(s). I tried countless creams/serums etc. but none of them had a lasting effect other than only not triggering my eczema and providing some relief. I always had to go back to steroid creams at some point. Until... this! Take my word when I say after using this cream, my steroid cream usage rate on my face decreased by 90%, if not more! I only remember I needed to use once, and that was because of an allergic reaction to a shampoo. This cream's soothing power is CRAZY.

I've got pretty bad eczema and in the winter really worsens. My face and neck are so sensitive to products and both are often red, flaky, and so tender. Regardless of the products that I've used, my skin gets so dry that it will crack causing serious discomfort. I've tried numerous different products over the years, spending SO much money and time trying to figure out what can work for my skin. This cream has truly been miraculous at healing my skin! I just got it a few days ago and I have been spending so much time looking in the mirror just in awe of how incredible my skins looks. There's barely any redness, no flaking at all, and the really tender spots on my face are almost completely healed after just three days of using this cream. As someone that has had such a hard time finding a product for my eczema prone and extremely sensitive skin, I cannot speak highly enough about this cream!

After two weeks, my skin looks elastic, healthy and no more deep wrinkles. Love this cream. I will continue to use Cicafalte at night in winter from now on.

Last year, I developed a terrible rash under my nose and around my mouth which I now believe was dermatitis.

The rash that had been burning, dry, and irritated for 2 months was gone after the first week of use. I couldn’t believe it. I used the cream alone after cleansing with warm water to let my skin rest. To this day, if I notice some redness or irritation forming I put this on and within hours my skin is soothed. I highly recommend this to all my friends and family and will never leave home without it now. Also, the price is well worth it. I’ve had it for almost a year and it is still very full - you really only need a bit for it to be effective. If you’re struggling with perioral dermatitis, give this a shot!

Because the radiation oncologist was concerned about residue on the skin that might interfere with the treatment, I would apply it twice a day, after treatment, and would wash it off gently with Basis soap before treatment. I don't have anything to compare it to, so this is far from a scientific finding, but I did get considerably more skin damage to an area I was not applying Cicalfate to (admittedly a more sensitive area--impossible to know how it would have fared with the Cicalfate). The radiation oncologist was impressed at how well my skin held up over the course of treatment, so all indications are that it is very effective in protecting the skin from the worst effects of radiation.",5 out of 5 stars.

Given the ongoing cold weather I asked for a refund which they gave. Great customer service! It did come with a heat pack but the heat pack was not warm by the time I opened the package.

433,Avene Cicalfate+ Restorative Protective Cream 100ml - Multi-purpose Repair cream,Anonymous,I previously used Cicalfate cream so when I saw this “plus” cream I was excited. It’s not a cream at all. It’s more the texture of a thin serum. I can shake the tube and it sounds like a bottle of water. It’s hard to control how much comes out. I thought maybe I’d received a defective tube but was told by an Avene rep via chat that it was supposed to be that way—which I find hard to believe.,3 out of 5 stars.

This is actually a great cream if you have very dry skin or are using a retinoid. It helps seal in the moisture loss. HOWEVER, it needs to be reformulated so that it can actually be shipped in cold weather months. I received my first bottle in mid December and it was completely separated; meaning the lotion was separated from the spring water in the formula. Is it still usable? Kinda. You have to squeeze all of the water out BEFORE the cream comes out and it’s a mess. Because all of the water squirts out, you’re literally throwing money down the drain!! This stuff is expensive. I’m not ok with that. I asked for a replacement. They gave me a replacement and it came the exact same way! It’s unusable to me and I’m throwing money down the drain. I’m now going to ask for a refund. Maybe it won’t separate in the warmer months?

It is a lovely light texture yet does a great job moisturizing. However, it has a strong fragrance which I wasn't expecting for a sensitive skin line.

617,Avène A-Oxitive DAY Smoothing Water-cream 30ml - Vitamin C Moisturiser,Alicia D.,"I won this cream in a competition from Beautyheaven. The A-Oxitive Smoothing Water-cream comes in a 30ml airless pump bottle that protects the formula from oxidation. The cream is non-comedogenic and of medium consistency and is white. I found it to be quite highly fragranced which I was surprised at because this particular cream is suitable for all types of sensitive skin -even the most sensitive (I have combination skin for reference). The cream contains vitamin c which is released gradually throughout the day. Normally with vitamin c I breakout but I didn't at all when using this water cream and I found it to be very gentle and nourishing. The cream is super lightweight and does an amazing job at hydrating my skin. My skin feels so smooth and silky. My skin overall looks refreshed, bright and luminous. The texture of my skin feels far more even. This cream is a great hydration booster and I will continue to keep this in my skincare routine.",4 out of 5 stars.

657,Avene Tolerance Hydra-10 Cream 40ml,ClaireWithAnAye,[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I've heard good things about this brand so thought it's about time I have a try........now I'm wondering why I haven't bought sooner.It comes packaged like a much higher ended product and I love the pump action of it which allows for the perfect application everytime.  The one thing that I first noticed on using it was the lack of a heavy perfume like all the other creams. It's texture is also somewhere between a lotion and a cream. It's disappears quickly into the skin and really is a pleasure to use. My skin felt hydrated and smooth and no BREAKOUTS. This is a very understaded moisturizer and I absolutely love it!!,5 out of 5 stars.

662,Avene Tolerance Hydra-10 Cream 40ml,Rainie,[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I have always suffered with very dry sensitive skin and have used many face creams over the years that claim to be effective and simply not worked for me. It's early days but I've been using this for a week and so far has been helping keep my skin hydrated. It's a small bottle at 40ml but only takes a single pump to give sufficient coverage and it leaves my skin feeling nice and soft with a noticeable small reduction in dryness and flaky patches. It's also almost odourless with a faint smell that I can't describe as pleasant but not really bad either but that's just my personal opinion on it. The fact it doesn't seem to be perfumed is a good thing after so many reactions to perfumed products. Time will tell but so far I'm happy with the results.,5 out of 5 stars.

678,Avene Tolerance Hydra-10 Cream 40ml,DreamsInBlack,"[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Over the last couple of years, my skin has become dehydrated and dull, probably due to peri-menopause, stress and poor sleep. I have tried so many products, quite a few of them with hyaluronic acid, with varying degrees of success, but this one works! It has a lovely texture, between a fluid and a light cream and applies beautifully. Absorbed easily, with no greasiness or residue, my skin feels immediately hydrated and moisturised. It looks and feels plumped and revitalised and not only remains like that all day, I've noticed a marked improvement in my skin over the short time I've been using this. Most noticeable is that the lines I'd started to get around my mouth have filled out, making them much less noticeable than they were previously, something I am really pleased about, and there has been some improvement in the fine lines around my eyes. I had expected this product to just be another moisturiser but it is so much more.  And that it uses 100% natural origin ingredients is even better. I really recommend giving this a try, it's gentle enough for even the most delicate of skins so definitely worth seeing if it can work for you or your family too.",5 out of 5 stars.

728,Avene Tolerance Hydra-10 Cream 40ml,Daimen,"[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] We recently came across this TOLERANCE HYDRA-10 MOISTURISING CREAM 40ml and thought we’d give it a try.

I loved the packaging and the pumple simple to use and felt sturdy. Just the right amount could be dispensed.  Applied very nicely onto my skin and instantly felt the moisture on my skin. It also felt somewhat greasy.  I applied my make up over the top and as the day went on it wasn't a great look. I found it a bit too heavy for my skin and brought me out in a few spots.  This is just my personal opinion and experience of how it felt on my skin so others may love it, all you can do is try.",3 out of 5 stars.

796,Avene A-Oxitive EYES Smoothing Eye Contour Cream 15ml - Vitamin A eye cream,lizzie33,The skin around my eyes felt smoother upon application and the appearance of my bags were lessened. I will continue to use the product to see the progress.,4 out of 5 stars.
797,Avene A-Oxitive EYES Smoothing Eye Contour Cream 15ml - Vitamin A eye cream,Courtney_90,I recently started using this product and have noticed a big difference in the firmness under my eye. I often have slight fine lines as I move into my 30s and this has really helped lessen the fine lines,4 out of 5 stars.
798,Avene A-Oxitive EYES Smoothing Eye Contour Cream 15ml - Vitamin A eye cream,educk,I have been using this eye cream for a week now. Nothing too noticible just yet. But I've noticed that it hydrates my eye area pretty well during winter. But I do love the light and gel like texture which gets absorb to the skin very easily. Just a tiny pill size is enough to go around both eyes. The convenient pump packaging makes it easy to dispense the product without any issue. The formula feels light and natural. Good product for it's value! Definitely keen to try other products from this range.,4 out of 5 stars.
799,Avene A-Oxitive EYES Smoothing Eye Contour Cream 15ml - Vitamin A eye cream,sam_s,"I havent used an eye cream before, so wasn't sure what to expect but I've read that others can be quite sticky, which this wasnt. It was a soft, creamier texture that absorbed well and left my eyes looking brighter.",4 out of 5 stars.
800,Avene A-Oxitive EYES Smoothing Eye Contour Cream 15ml - Vitamin A eye cream,Stephanie L,"Loved this product! as i start to see the signs of ageing around my eyes the most, this cream has really helped blur the lines that usually appear throughout the day. It's not irritating and doesn't ball up like most of my other eye creams do!",4 out of 5 stars.
801,Avene A-Oxitive EYES Smoothing Eye Contour Cream 15ml - Vitamin A eye cream,Lauraje123,Im always wary of eye creams and what they purport to do. I did notice after a few nights that my eyes were a little smoother and softer. Still dark patches under my eyes unfortunately but thats likely due to having a newborn and no cream can take that away! Happy with this product,4 out of 5 stars.
802,Avene A-Oxitive EYES Smoothing Eye Contour Cream 15ml - Vitamin A eye cream,Dorz,"Have been using this for a few weeks now and must say it feels nice. Its light and not oily, doesnt make my eyes water overnight. But not sure how effective it is",4 out of 5 stars.
803,Avene A-Oxitive EYES Smoothing Eye Contour Cream 15ml - Vitamin A eye cream,Kylie8,The jury is out on this for me at the moment. I initially experienced some irritation after use but this has settled down now. However I can’t say I’ve seen any noticeable difference or change. Have been using for about a month. Probably won’t buy again,3 out of 5 stars.
804,Avene A-Oxitive EYES Smoothing Eye Contour Cream 15ml - Vitamin A eye cream,katywlee,I have been using this for a few weeks and haven't really noticed a difference. I guess it has good hydration but other than that doesn't really do too much else,3 out of 5 stars.
805,Avene A-Oxitive EYES Smoothing Eye Contour Cream 15ml - Vitamin A eye cream,rosie314,"I have tried this product for about 2 weeks now.  This eye cream comes in a lightweight texture.  Due to the formula that contains Retinaldehyde, I use it at night.  It feels hydrating and smoother in that area.  But I personally don't quite like this product because it's quite runny. I highly recommend you to use less than half of a pump for both eyes.  A full pump will be a waste of product.",3 out of 5 stars.
806,Avene A-Oxitive EYES Smoothing Eye Contour Cream 15ml - Vitamin A eye cream,EBBB1,"I was gifted this cream - I am not usually one to use an eye cream specifically. I liked the cream overall, it was light, thin in texture and applied well and it goes a long way. It had a slight cooling effect when I used it. I don't know if I would purchase it myself (I've been using for 2 weeks) just because I like a simple routine and can't see myself applying an eye cream over the long term religiously, but it was overall a smooth product to use.",3 out of 5 stars.

High-end, expensive creams, gels, toners, sprays, masks so many things. This little starter kit said it would noticibly change my skin in 7 days. It definitely did! I also bought the Avene Thermal Water and use that as a toner and all round refresher throughout the the day. I also purchased the scrub. For best results. I used this pack of goodness and the extra 2 products and my skin is on its way to being less congested. Dramatic results already (day 8) I agree with the person above only about the photo being old stock. However the cleanser will last a long time for me. Stick to the instructions and double cleanse.",5 out of 5 stars.
811,Avene Cleanance Starter Kit - For Oily skin,User37382928737282929,The products don’t look the same size as the picture shown. The pump thing came in 2 very small squeezable bottles and the cleanser came in a small cylinder bottle that will probably last about a month or less.,2 out of 5 stars.

819,Avene A-Oxitive NIGHT Peeling Cream 30ml - Vitamin A moisturiser,Alexandra Paige,This is great because it is more of a gradual peel and you can choose to use it more or less in a week to achieve the desired result. My skin can become quite irritated if it's overstimulated but this peel is more gentle as well as having the other ingredients to protect the skin to keep it happy. Highly recommend for all skin types.,5 out of 5 stars.

I persevered as there was no irritation or redness and after a few uses my skin was baby soft after it adjusted to the product.

836,Avene A-Oxitive NIGHT Peeling Cream 30ml - Vitamin A moisturiser,akalalouie,I've been using this for a few weeks and have noticed a gradual but noticeable improvement in skin texture. The peeling component is very gentle and the cream sits very lightly - it's not super rich.

837,Avene A-Oxitive NIGHT Peeling Cream 30ml - Vitamin A moisturiser,Anonymous,"I have been using this cream for about 3 weeks now, the very first thing i noticed was how quickly my skin absorbed it and unlike other night creams i have used in the past its not greasy at all.

839,Avene A-Oxitive NIGHT Peeling Cream 30ml - Vitamin A moisturiser,Calli L,"I have sensitive skin and this product is really great as the lightweight formula didn't aggravate my skin! I use it right before bed as part of my PM routine and when I wake up in the morning I could tell the difference in the texture and appearance of my skin right away. My skin was a lot smoother and all the dead skin that piles up in winter had been gently removed. Really great product. If you are nervous you can apply for a few hours and wash off before bed and follow with some moisturiser and see how your skin tolerates the formula, or use it once a week to start.",5 out of 5 stars.
840,Avene A-Oxitive NIGHT Peeling Cream 30ml - Vitamin A moisturiser,Passionately Sarah,This product is a great alternative to some of the harsher peels out there.

846,Avene A-Oxitive NIGHT Peeling Cream 30ml - Vitamin A moisturiser,sydneyswans910,"This lotion is fantastic to use. It’s light and glides onto my skin really nicely. To properly test it out, I applied to one side of my face only, and I can definitely say there was a noticeable difference. My skin was more radiant, clear and smooth. I have acne-prone skin and the night peeling cream also didn’t aggravate my skin or cause any pimples. It also didn’t irritate my skin, which makes this a fantastic retinol product. The satin finish was really nice, and was absorbed readily into my skin. The product has a yellow tint so it does slightly make my face look a little yellow, but as this is a night product, I didn’t find it to be an issue. I love that it’s fragrance free and gentle for every day use. The packaging is also a major plus, as it’s an airless pump. I am so happy with the results!",5 out of 5 stars.

I have oily skin and it did not cause slipperiness or produce excess oil. It has also not broken me out or caused any clogging of pores that a lot of serums tend to do. No harsh feeling with the active ingredients either. The packaging is quite nice and overall would recommend you try it.",5 out of 5 stars.

This has been an absolute staple in my skin care routine. I find this very comparative to some expensive skin care brands I’ve tried. I love the twist top to lock the product in, saving me from a mess when placing it into my skincare bag. I’ve been using this product a few weeks and have seen a notíciele change in my skin texture and fine lines already. My skin looks and feels noticeably plump and hydrated.

I like the lid so there is no chance of leaking. There is little to no scent. I found it was gentle on my sensitive skin as I am usually scared of any peeling/active products. It also absorbs easily into my combo, oily acne skin and sits well with my essences and moisturisers. I like to use the Avene thermal spray prior to use.",4 out of 5 stars.
859,Avene A-Oxitive NIGHT Peeling Cream 30ml - Vitamin A moisturiser,SilverFace,"Cream texture is smooth and light, quick absorption, no fragrance. After applying the cream, face feels smooth and moisturised; skin feel and appear smooth and taut the morning after. No skin allergy through the test period.While the face cream is nice to use, at times when the air is really dry, the cream feels a bit light and not moisturising enough; I expect this cream to be good to use throughout summer. Since the cream is supposed to be used after serum, the experience may be very different when used after serum.",4 out of 5 stars.
860,Avene A-Oxitive NIGHT Peeling Cream 30ml - Vitamin A moisturiser,Eazza11,"I purchased a month  ago and it truly is a great product, at first I was very unsure about it and if it would even work, I’ve used it a few times and can see what the product was designed for but I think I need to keep using it to get better results.",4 out of 5 stars.

863,Avene A-Oxitive NIGHT Peeling Cream 30ml - Vitamin A moisturiser,Tizzys,"I’ve been easing into this over the last few weeks and so far so good. Having sensitive skin it can be a painful process to introduce new items, but this cream hasn’t caused any flare ups or purging. The cream is quite orange and somewhat thick. There’s no distinct smell and it goes on easily and sinks in well. If you’re particularly sensitive or dry I’d recommend popping an oil or thicker moisturiser over the top.",4 out of 5 stars.
864,Avene A-Oxitive NIGHT Peeling Cream 30ml - Vitamin A moisturiser,JA87,"Overall I was happy with this night cream from Avene. After using it for nearly 3 weeks I can see a difference in my skin texture - it is much smoother and looks more plump than before, and the fine lines on my forehead are much less noticeable. The cream is light, absorbs very quickly, and is fragrance free which is great for sensitive skin. The pump bottle is also really easy to use. The only downside for me was that my skin still felt quite dry after use as I often use a very thick moisturiser overnight in winter. However, I found by using this cream first, then popping on a layer of another moisturiser an hour or so later before bed, I could get around the dryness.",4 out of 5 stars.
865,Avene A-Oxitive NIGHT Peeling Cream 30ml - Vitamin A moisturiser,LiliRiches,"Highly recommend for a refreshing boost if you have dull skin and wanting to improve the smoothness and even skin tone issues, I found it is easy to use and particular enjoy this fragrance-free product, as I always believe skin care product should never have fragrance as they can be potentially problematic for your skin. I am also a big fan of using this A-Oxitive ingredients at night, and letting it do its magic at night, however wearing sunscreen the next day is a MUST!",4 out of 5 stars.

874,Avene A-Oxitive NIGHT Peeling Cream 30ml - Vitamin A moisturiser,Ls2323,"A beautiful lightweight cream. I either use it on top of clean toned skin or a bit of hydrating serum. I have used some Korean brand peeling cream where the product peels off, this cream doesn't work in that manner. I sleep with it on overnight, it does it's work and I wash it off in the morning. It gives me a beautiful glowing complexion! I enjoyed this product and good for sensitive skin too.",4 out of 5 stars.

The cream is easy to apply and quick absorbing. It is a non greasy texture that makes an excellent base for applying makeup. It soothes inflamed skin and does not cause any irritation even around the eye area. It is so gentle I use it on my toddlers face. A cream that the whole family can use is a major advantage over other brands. It moisturises from first but after a week of applying twice a day there has been a noticeable difference my skin is calmer, nourished and smoother this is thanks to the hyaluronic acid.

Up until now I have found it to be  non-greasy and really hydrating fluid for my sins as it tends to get dry even in summer months without moisturiser being applied.I tried the fluid to see the claim of 48 hours of facial hydration/moisturisation and it largely feels true. The skin felt non dry for this period without the need for any top up. I think one of the other great thing is that the ingredients are primarily natural.

On the end of the tube there is a pump which is a really nice addition and I found that there is no waste due to this. The cream itself has a nice consistency.  There is no smell which I guess is okay but I think I'd of preferred a scent to it.  I have found that my skin felt good once applied but I did need to reapply more throughout the day.

Unfortunately I found it left my face sticky so using it in the morning before applying make up is not pheasible. Whilst it did have some moisturisation it wasn't the level I had hoped for. I did love the pump at the top which keeps it clean and means you get all the product from the tube. The tube itself is all in french, which isn't great when you have thrown the box out ! Overall disappointed. Its just not for me.",3 out of 5 stars.

I use this one a week or before makeup application for an event and it gives a nice soothing, moisturizing, refreshing glow to my skin. The fact that there is so much product in the bottle and the texture is lightweight you can apply as much as much as you want and still get many uses. I’ve used it four times and the bottle still feels full! I apply it in soft layers then a thick layer to finish it off.

The description on the box specifies it's for sensitive skin, but I think this is suitable for a wide range of skintypes except oily.  It's like a thick moisturiser in its consistency and feels pleasant on my skin after application. My skin looks and feels like it has had a drink of water after using it. The instructions say to leave it on for 10 -15 minutes but I think you should leave it on for a bit longer if your skin is dry, it doesn't do any harm. It feels soothing on my skin just as it promises and I don't feel I need to apply moisturiser after using this, I just wipe it off with a cotton pad as instructed and my skin is left feeling and looking great.",5 out of 5 stars.

1000,Avene Soothing Radiance Mask 50ml - Mask for Dry Sensitive skin,Anne F.,"I have been using some of the Eau Thermale skincare for a few years now, and I am excited to see that their skincare has been added to Beauty Crew’s line-up of products so I can finally review them. Avene is one of those well-loved French pharmacy brands that provide good skincare without the hefty price tag. The Eau Thermale range uses plant oils and fruit extracts along with thermal spring water to provide a hydrating and non-irritating mask. I smooth on a thickish layer after cleansing and leave on for 10-15 minutes. It feels very cooling and soothing as it goes on and lives up to its name – there is absolutely nothing irritating about this mask, no dryness or tightness at all after using, and it is virtually unscented. After 10 minutes it is ready to wipe and then rinse off. After patting dry, you are left with a glowing and brighter complexion  – yes, it lives up to another promise. I will say that it isn’t the most hydrating mask I have used, and I always follow with a good serum and night cream, but if you are looking for an affordable mask to wake up your complexion without irritating your skin, then I can confidently recommend Avene. Love this range!",4 out of 5 stars.

1054,Avene Xeracalm A.D Ultra-Rich Cleansing Bar 100g,Joseph P.,I bought this bar soap due to the great reviews. I was so disappointed to find it has Sodium Lauryl Sulfate on the ingredient list. SLS is what helps make suds/foam and is very drying to the skin. I can’t recommend this soap. It’s drying.,1 out of 5 stars.
