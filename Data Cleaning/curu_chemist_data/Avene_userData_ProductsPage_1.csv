It was never too serious, but it always came and go and I was never able to figure out the exact trigger(s). I tried countless creams/serums etc. but none of them had a lasting effect other than only not triggering my eczema and providing some relief. I always had to go back to steroid creams at some point. Until... this! Take my word when I say after using this cream, my steroid cream usage rate on my face decreased by 90%, if not more! I only remember I needed to use once, and that was because of an allergic reaction to a shampoo. This cream's soothing power is CRAZY.

I've got pretty bad eczema and in the winter really worsens. My face and neck are so sensitive to products and both are often red, flaky, and so tender. Regardless of the products that I've used, my skin gets so dry that it will crack causing serious discomfort. I've tried numerous different products over the years, spending SO much money and time trying to figure out what can work for my skin. This cream has truly been miraculous at healing my skin! I just got it a few days ago and I have been spending so much time looking in the mirror just in awe of how incredible my skins looks. There's barely any redness, no flaking at all, and the really tender spots on my face are almost completely healed after just three days of using this cream. As someone that has had such a hard time finding a product for my eczema prone and extremely sensitive skin, I cannot speak highly enough about this cream!

After two weeks, my skin looks elastic, healthy and no more deep wrinkles. Love this cream. I will continue to use Cicafalte at night in winter from now on.

Last year, I developed a terrible rash under my nose and around my mouth which I now believe was dermatitis.

The rash that had been burning, dry, and irritated for 2 months was gone after the first week of use. I couldn’t believe it. I used the cream alone after cleansing with warm water to let my skin rest. To this day, if I notice some redness or irritation forming I put this on and within hours my skin is soothed. I highly recommend this to all my friends and family and will never leave home without it now. Also, the price is well worth it. I’ve had it for almost a year and it is still very full - you really only need a bit for it to be effective. If you’re struggling with perioral dermatitis, give this a shot!

Because the radiation oncologist was concerned about residue on the skin that might interfere with the treatment, I would apply it twice a day, after treatment, and would wash it off gently with Basis soap before treatment. I don't have anything to compare it to, so this is far from a scientific finding, but I did get considerably more skin damage to an area I was not applying Cicalfate to (admittedly a more sensitive area--impossible to know how it would have fared with the Cicalfate). The radiation oncologist was impressed at how well my skin held up over the course of treatment, so all indications are that it is very effective in protecting the skin from the worst effects of radiation.",5 out of 5 stars.

Given the ongoing cold weather I asked for a refund which they gave. Great customer service! It did come with a heat pack but the heat pack was not warm by the time I opened the package.

433,Avene Cicalfate+ Restorative Protective Cream 100ml - Multi-purpose Repair cream,Anonymous,I previously used Cicalfate cream so when I saw this “plus” cream I was excited. It’s not a cream at all. It’s more the texture of a thin serum. I can shake the tube and it sounds like a bottle of water. It’s hard to control how much comes out. I thought maybe I’d received a defective tube but was told by an Avene rep via chat that it was supposed to be that way—which I find hard to believe.,3 out of 5 stars.

This is actually a great cream if you have very dry skin or are using a retinoid. It helps seal in the moisture loss. HOWEVER, it needs to be reformulated so that it can actually be shipped in cold weather months. I received my first bottle in mid December and it was completely separated; meaning the lotion was separated from the spring water in the formula. Is it still usable? Kinda. You have to squeeze all of the water out BEFORE the cream comes out and it’s a mess. Because all of the water squirts out, you’re literally throwing money down the drain!! This stuff is expensive. I’m not ok with that. I asked for a replacement. They gave me a replacement and it came the exact same way! It’s unusable to me and I’m throwing money down the drain. I’m now going to ask for a refund. Maybe it won’t separate in the warmer months?

513,Avene Thermal Spring Water 300ml - Mist for Sensitive skin,Audra,"I was skeptical. It is water. It is not a laser. It is not a high priced cream formulated by a trendy dermatologist. What is water going to do? Golly, was I proven wrong! I have much sun damage from being a child growing up in the late 70s and early 80s in California. Sunscreen? What's that? ""Pass the Ban De Soliel for the Sun"" as the commercials went. In the late 80s and early 90s I was a swimmer. I discovered sunscreen, but then became a distance swimmer. You can't exactly stop and reapply sunscreen in the middle of an ocean swim or you get disqualified if you touch the boat. I was young and stupid and about sun protection. I have a lot of sun damage from being young and stupid. Now as a cancer survivor I have a few large slit scars from surgery. The one on my neck from my thyroidectomy REALLY bothers me. This water is healing my skin!!! Again, it is just the thermal mineral and prebiotic water. It is miraculous! My skepticism was proven out the window! It is healing my sun damage. It is lessening the appearance of and softening my surgical scars. It is a God send for eczema flares and otherwise irritated or angry skin. How did I make it into my mid forties never hearing or this product or using it before? If you were skeptical like me, give it a go. You'll never be more pleased you were proven wrong. This is not only a ""game changer"" as some over say it is a watery miracle. Now I believe the people who go to the destinations for the healing waters. I'm saving up for trip to the Avene spa myself. It is safe for we of the supersensitive skin. It is safe for we cancer patients. Check with your doctor before hand/I am not a doctor nor doling out medical advice but I would spray this on a radiation burn zebra stripe without hesitating. Same with a sun burn. It is the ONLY thing now I used during an eczema flare up or summer mosquito bite. To summarize: I'm a former skeptic now preaching this product.",5 out of 5 stars.

566,Avene Thermal Spring Water 300ml - Mist for Sensitive skin,Casey M.,"At 42, I began to deal with cystic/nodular acne. So, my dermatologist prescribed me acne treatments (Doxycycline, Clindamycin topical gel, retinol) to treat my acne. The treatments caused my skin to react by becoming dry, flaky and itchy. Redness on my cheeks also appeared. This moisturizer targeted these reactions amazingly well. It soothes my skin - reduces redness and itchy skin and hydrates my skin - removes my dry and flaky skin! After applying this moisturizer, I can easily apply my makeup without any of these skin irritations. All of my skin's reactions from the treatments are gone - like magic! I use in combination with the Cleanance Hydra soothing face wash and thermal spring water toner spray. The scent of the products are amazing too! Would recommend to anyone in need of a moisturizer to help alleviate skin irritations from acne treatments.",5 out of 5 stars.

I am a sensitive shaver however and for quite some time, hadn't found a way of reducing the irritation (not to mention the spots) post shave. Well the other day I sprayed the Eau Thermale Spring Water over my legs after pat drying from my shower/shave and days later, I still didn't get irritation or red post shave spots!!! High recommend!",5 out of 5 stars.

It's an item that you can see makes a beautiful difference in your skin. I bought 2 for my sisters to try to see if they love it as much as I do and a giant one for myself.

My current skin is midway through second pregnancy - which means a mixture of break outs and dry patches which really hurt.  I found the spring water to be the perfect product to put on my skin post washing my face, it was instantly cooling and hydrating.  It didn't seem to aggravate the dry patches and I didn't notice an increase in pimples.  It was also really easy to put my serum, moisturiser etc ontop. Would definitely get again!",5 out of 5 stars.

856,Avene Thermal Spring Water 300ml - Mist for Sensitive skin,Megan G.,[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I was surprised at how quickly this product helped ease my skin irritation following a flare up of eczema and contact dermatitis on both my face and my body.

857,Avene Thermal Spring Water 300ml - Mist for Sensitive skin,Jess U.,"[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] The Avène Thermal Spring Water is a mist that provides soothing, softening benefits for sensitive, hypersensitive and allergic skin. Like most people, I was pretty sceptical about this and thought it was simply expensive water in can. The nozzle and pressure of the can provides a good volume of mist and coverage, and is easy to use on the face or all over the body. The thermal spring water has been refreshing and soothing, especially on days when my skin is dry, red or irritated. I have noticed that after using the spray, it provides a nice soothing feeling, calms down the redness and irritation on the skin, and a nice hydration boost before moisturising to lock that moisture. It is really easy to use, simply point the nozzle and spray, giving a bit of time and pat down to dry. This product is multipurpose and great to leave in the fridge for a cool refreshing spritz especially on a hot day or to help sooth any irritation or redness. Though it is pretty expensive to simply use as a cooling mist. I do like the soothing effects, minimising irritation and redness, as well as the hydration boost before moisturising.",5 out of 5 stars.
858,Avene Thermal Spring Water 300ml - Mist for Sensitive skin,Linda K.,"[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Before testing this product out, I was kept sceptical. However, as someone who suffers from dry skin and eczema, I was pleasantly surprised with the results this spring water provided. It's almost an all-purpose skin spray; I used it before applying makeup and also on my dry skin. It's added hydration to my skin and is very soothing I would also say I was surprised by how big the 300mL was. I would, however, repurchase the smaller bottle just to keep in my handbag to refresh my face.",5 out of 5 stars.

865,Avene Thermal Spring Water 300ml - Mist for Sensitive skin,Lucy N.,[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I have been curious about Avène Thermal Spring Water for a while now but was skeptical of it's claims as it seemed like just water in a can.

866,Avene Thermal Spring Water 300ml - Mist for Sensitive skin,Erica D.,"[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Coming into summer I am so excited to use this. I have incorporated it into my every day routine from morning to night - it's great to spray over your face to wake up in the morning before applying serums and moisturisers, can be used throughout the day to refresh dull, dry looking make up without it shifting or sliding off, and before bed for a lasting hit of hydration before applying heavier creams.I also kept this in the fridge and used it on almost sunburnt skin and found it so hydrating and non sticky (unlike moisturisers/aloe gel).",5 out of 5 stars.
867,Avene Thermal Spring Water 300ml - Mist for Sensitive skin,Joyce C.,"[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] The effects of this spray has really surprised me – it’s so soothing and refreshing, and really helps hydrate my otherwise dry and sensitive face.

868,Avene Thermal Spring Water 300ml - Mist for Sensitive skin,Helen D.,"[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I love this refreshing spray! I guess it's hard to write a review and the number one thing that people wonder is &quot;do I need this?&quot; And if you're even considering buying this, I'm going to say yes and here's why...It's so versatile and refreshing!!!! There are just so many uses and I particularly loved the tip of popping it in the fridge for a cold mist. I must say, I particularly loved it after a beach visit to freshen up and prevent my face going crusty or salty from the beach! I love it as a base/first step for skincare as I find products get absorbed better when there is a little premoisture/hydration. I love it to refresh my makeup-spray a little at the end of the day and you feel fresher. Dab away any extra moisture and oil and you'll look as good as new! Whilst this product isn't an &quot;essential&quot; like say, an SPF or moisturiser, I think it is an essential in that once you have it you'll wonder how you did without it.",5 out of 5 stars.
869,Avene Thermal Spring Water 300ml - Mist for Sensitive skin,Julia N.,[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] SUCH a refreshing product.

870,Avene Thermal Spring Water 300ml - Mist for Sensitive skin,Talia C.,"[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] This water spray really surprised me! It was super hydrating and calming. I love to use this morning and night after cleansing for a smooth hydrated base before I apply my other skincare products. My sensitive skin had a reaction to another product, and after spraying this I definitely saw a visible improvement in the irritation and the redness completely went away. The spray is so refreshing, I love having this bottle on my bedside table to really wake me up in the morning or spray during the night to cool down. I can already tell this is going to be a staple for me in summer. Although the bottle is quite large, it’s easy to hold and use and you get a lot of product! The mist feels amazing and distributes the product perfectly across the face. This is definitely a product for people who want to treat themselves and add a luxurious extra step to their skincare routine!",5 out of 5 stars.
871,Avene Thermal Spring Water 300ml - Mist for Sensitive skin,Beverly,Avene Thermal Spring Water is everything it says it is. It is so soothing after you cleanse your face. I will continue to keep it next to my cleanser. It also is a delightful treat to use anytime.,5 out of 5 stars.
872,Avene Thermal Spring Water 300ml - Mist for Sensitive skin,Tahlee A.,[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] This product does exactly what it sets out to do- hydrate and revitalise. Whilst trying out this product I tried it in a variety of ways:1. I have quite dry skin especially on my legs and in particular my shins. Applying this added moisture back and especially after going to the beach and being that bit salty! Great for summer!2. When applying make up it generally looks great straight away but can look a bit dried out- applying this added more of a glossy look and refreshed my make up.Overall I would definitely recommend this product.,5 out of 5 stars.
873,Avene Thermal Spring Water 300ml - Mist for Sensitive skin,Soraya M.,"[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] This product is such a skincare staple!I always use this as a 'spritz' after cleansing, and before applying my serums (for added hydration). If I'm going to the beach, I also bring this along for an added hydrating spritz in summer. It's even more cooling if you store it in the fridge.I like the big bottle for home usage, the mini bottles are good for 'travel'. I didn't necessarily see any reduction in 'redness', however my usage of this product is primarily to 'refresh' the face and skin. I recommend this product for everyone of all ages.",5 out of 5 stars.

875,Avene Thermal Spring Water 300ml - Mist for Sensitive skin,Natasha M.,"[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I surprisingly enjoyed trialling Avène’s Thermal Spring Water product. I have never used a mist such as this one before and found it very convenient on the go, especially after a run or exercising. It immediately soothes irritation and softens skin. The spray bottle is so convenient to use and I didn’t actually find the need to pat dry after a few minutes as it easily absorbed into skin. It can also be used throughout the day over makeup and doesn’t let it slide away. Would overall recommend this product.",5 out of 5 stars.
876,Avene Thermal Spring Water 300ml - Mist for Sensitive skin,Susan H.,I am truly in love with this product! I use it everyday after I put on face makeup and throughout the day to refresh myself.

879,Avene Thermal Spring Water 300ml - Mist for Sensitive skin,Anonymous,I first received this spray in a Fab Fit Fun box and I instantly fell in love. I spray this on my face and neck when I need a refresher throughout the day and after I wash my face. We have really hard water in Indianapolis so I love to be able to put good water on my face right after washing. I definitely notice a better complexion as a result when I use Avène Thermal Spring Water!! This is definitely a new must-have in my daily routine.,5 out of 5 stars.
880,Avene Thermal Spring Water 300ml - Mist for Sensitive skin,Andrea D.,"This is one of my must-have products. I have oily and sensitive skin that can flare up due to allergens in the air. Spritzing this on instantly calms my skin and is very soothing. I use this primarily as a toner after cleanser and before applying serum. I find this helps to prevent any flare ups, especially in spring during hayfever season. This is also great for travel and in the office when the air is quite dry. A single pump really helps to inject moisture back into the skin. The spray is a very fine mist that distributes evenly without dripping.

1088,Avene Cicalfate+ Restorative Protective Cream 100ml - Multi-purpose Repair cream,Cansu P.,"I want to start off by saying that I have been a long-time facial eczema sufferer. It was never too serious, but it always came and go and I was never able to figure out the exact trigger(s). I tried countless creams/serums etc. but none of them had a lasting effect other than only not triggering my eczema and providing some relief. I always had to go back to steroid creams at some point. Until... this! Take my word when I say after using this cream, my steroid cream usage rate on my face decreased by 90%, if not more! I only remember I needed to use once, and that was because of an allergic reaction to a shampoo. This cream's soothing power is CRAZY. I use it on my eczema-prone spots on my face but it can also be used on the whole face if needed. I'm telling you, this cream is my holy grail.

Regardless of the products that I've used, my skin gets so dry that it will crack causing serious discomfort. I've tried numerous different products over the years, spending SO much money and time trying to figure out what can work for my skin. This cream has truly been miraculous at healing my skin! I just got it a few days ago and I have been spending so much time looking in the mirror just in awe of how incredible my skins looks. There's barely any redness, no flaking at all, and the really tender spots on my face are almost completely healed after just three days of using this cream. As someone that has had such a hard time finding a product for my eczema prone and extremely sensitive skin, I cannot speak highly enough about this cream!

1372,Avene Cicalfate+ Restorative Protective Cream 100ml - Multi-purpose Repair cream,Marc B.,"I used Cicalfate during radiation treatments, and it seems to have done an excellent job of keeping my skin from getting too red or blistering. Because the radiation oncologist was concerned about residue on the skin that might interfere with the treatment, I would apply it twice a day, after treatment, and would wash it off gently with Basis soap before treatment. I don't have anything to compare it to, so this is far from a scientific finding, but I did get considerably more skin damage to an area I was not applying Cicalfate to (admittedly a more sensitive area--impossible to know how it would have fared with the Cicalfate). The radiation oncologist was impressed at how well my skin held up over the course of treatment, so all indications are that it is very effective in protecting the skin from the worst effects of radiation.",5 out of 5 stars.

Given the ongoing cold weather I asked for a refund which they gave. Great customer service! It did come with a heat pack but the heat pack was not warm by the time I opened the package. I will definitely purchase during warmer months online but in colder weather will only buy it in a store.,3 out of 5 stars.

1446,Avene Cicalfate+ Restorative Protective Cream 100ml - Multi-purpose Repair cream,Jennifer O.,I love this cream and have been using and recommending it for years. It is the only thing that heals and prevents my peri-oral dermatitis. The last couple of times I've bought the product it has been separated in the tube and all the liquid comes rushing out when it is first opened. It seems impossible to emulsify the cream again. I continue to use the thicker cream but Im sure some ingredients are lost in the fluid and I don't like the texture as much.,3 out of 5 stars.

1454,Avene Cicalfate+ Restorative Protective Cream 100ml - Multi-purpose Repair cream,Anonymous,I previously used Cicalfate cream so when I saw this “plus” cream I was excited. It’s not a cream at all. It’s more the texture of a thin serum. I can shake the tube and it sounds like a bottle of water. It’s hard to control how much comes out. I thought maybe I’d received a defective tube but was told by an Avene rep via chat that it was supposed to be that way—which I find hard to believe.,3 out of 5 stars.

1461,Avene Cicalfate+ Restorative Protective Cream 100ml - Multi-purpose Repair cream,Anonymous,"I’m completely annoyed. This is actually a great cream if you have very dry skin or are using a retinoid. It helps seal in the moisture loss. HOWEVER, it needs to be reformulated so that it can actually be shipped in cold weather months. I received my first bottle in mid December and it was completely separated; meaning the lotion was separated from the spring water in the formula. Is it still usable? Kinda. You have to squeeze all of the water out BEFORE the cream comes out and it’s a mess. Because all of the water squirts out, you’re literally throwing money down the drain!! This stuff is expensive. I’m not ok with that. I asked for a replacement. They gave me a replacement and it came the exact same way! It’s unusable to me and I’m throwing money down the drain. I’m now going to ask for a refund. Maybe it won’t separate in the warmer months? And if anyone from Avene is looking at this review, the heat pack obviously doesn’t work and is a waste.",2 out of 5 stars.

I called Avene to confirm that the formula has changed. This new Cicalfate + has a postbiotic, is not as occlusive, and much harder to rub in. It's just not as great as the original.

I purchased Cicalfate+ as a last ditch effort, and BAM within 1 week the Perioral Dermatitis appearance was dramatically better and in 2 weeks it was not even noticeable.

Last year, I developed a terrible rash under my nose and around my mouth which I now believe was dermatitis.

The rash that had been burning, dry, and irritated for 2 months was gone after the first week of use. I couldn’t believe it. I used the cream alone after cleansing with warm water to let my skin rest. To this day, if I notice some redness or irritation forming I put this on and within hours my skin is soothed. I highly recommend this to all my friends and family and will never leave home without it now. Also, the price is well worth it. I’ve had it for almost a year and it is still very full - you really only need a bit for it to be effective. If you’re struggling with perioral dermatitis, give this a shot!

I started using this as a barrier cream to protect the undereye skin and allow me to use retinal, vitamin c and other products that were too irritating. I can't live without it now.

1893,Avene Cicalfate+ Restorative Protective Cream 40ml - Multi-purpose Repair cream,Marc B.,"I used Cicalfate during radiation treatments, and it seems to have done an excellent job of keeping my skin from getting too red or blistering. Because the radiation oncologist was concerned about residue on the skin that might interfere with the treatment, I would apply it twice a day, after treatment, and would wash it off gently with Basis soap before treatment. I don't have anything to compare it to, so this is far from a scientific finding, but I did get considerably more skin damage to an area I was not applying Cicalfate to (admittedly a more sensitive area--impossible to know how it would have fared with the Cicalfate). The radiation oncologist was impressed at how well my skin held up over the course of treatment, so all indications are that it is very effective in protecting the skin from the worst effects of radiation.",5 out of 5 stars.

When I saw this was for 'very sensitive skin' it pricked my interest! I'd say first impressions were it had a pleasant smell to it and the consistency wasn't too thick, I was able to apply it onto my hands quite easily. I also tried it on my face but I didn't feel I was getting results and my face ended up feeling a bit greasy after.

2007,Avene Cicalfate+ Restorative Protective Cream 40ml - Multi-purpose Repair cream,Anonymous,I previously used Cicalfate cream so when I saw this “plus” cream I was excited. It’s not a cream at all. It’s more the texture of a thin serum. I can shake the tube and it sounds like a bottle of water. It’s hard to control how much comes out. I thought maybe I’d received a defective tube but was told by an Avene rep via chat that it was supposed to be that way—which I find hard to believe.,3 out of 5 stars.

2014,Avene Cicalfate+ Restorative Protective Cream 40ml - Multi-purpose Repair cream,Anonymous,"I’m completely annoyed. This is actually a great cream if you have very dry skin or are using a retinoid. It helps seal in the moisture loss. HOWEVER, it needs to be reformulated so that it can actually be shipped in cold weather months. I received my first bottle in mid December and it was completely separated; meaning the lotion was separated from the spring water in the formula. Is it still usable? Kinda. You have to squeeze all of the water out BEFORE the cream comes out and it’s a mess. Because all of the water squirts out, you’re literally throwing money down the drain!! This stuff is expensive. I’m not ok with that. I asked for a replacement. They gave me a replacement and it came the exact same way! It’s unusable to me and I’m throwing money down the drain. I’m now going to ask for a refund. Maybe it won’t separate in the warmer months?

It is so cooling, soothing and refreshing it really helps wakes my skin up with each pass over my skin. The great thing is that it also comes in a range of sizes so I have one wherever I am, I have the largest sized bottle (300ml) in my bedroom at home and the smaller version (50ml or 150ml) in my handbag so that I have it with me all day everyday.

I have been using it for 4 years now after suffering sensitive skin from Rosacea.  I use it to cool down my face in over heated environments, as a final toner after cleansing and also to prep my skin for moisturiser application.  The soothing property of the spring water really does settle the redness of my skin and any inflammatory irritation that occurs from the environment.  The fact that the can comes in various sizes means I can also bring one on the go with me.  The travel size is small enough to bring traveling or to the gym! I would highly recommend this product and in my opinion the price range is a good value if you need a soothing application.",5 out of 5 stars.

My current skin is midway through second pregnancy - which means a mixture of break outs and dry patches which really hurt.  I found the spring water to be the perfect product to put on my skin post washing my face, it was instantly cooling and hydrating.  It didn't seem to aggravate the dry patches and I didn't notice an increase in pimples.  It was also really easy to put my serum, moisturiser etc ontop. Would definitely get again!",5 out of 5 stars.
2091,Avene Thermal Spring Water 50ml - Mist for Sensitive skin,Megan G.,[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I was surprised at how quickly this product helped ease my skin irritation following a flare up of eczema and contact dermatitis on both my face and my body. The extra boost of cooling moisture helped reduce the dryness and irritation. I would definitely recommend this product for anyone looking for a cooling spray for warmer months,5 out of 5 stars.
2092,Avene Thermal Spring Water 50ml - Mist for Sensitive skin,Jess U.,"[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] The Avène Thermal Spring Water is a mist that provides soothing, softening benefits for sensitive, hypersensitive and allergic skin. Like most people, I was pretty sceptical about this and thought it was simply expensive water in can. The nozzle and pressure of the can provides a good volume of mist and coverage, and is easy to use on the face or all over the body. The thermal spring water has been refreshing and soothing, especially on days when my skin is dry, red or irritated. I have noticed that after using the spray, it provides a nice soothing feeling, calms down the redness and irritation on the skin, and a nice hydration boost before moisturising to lock that moisture. It is really easy to use, simply point the nozzle and spray, giving a bit of time and pat down to dry. This product is multipurpose and great to leave in the fridge for a cool refreshing spritz especially on a hot day or to help sooth any irritation or redness. Though it is pretty expensive to simply use as a cooling mist. I do like the soothing effects, minimising irritation and redness, as well as the hydration boost before moisturising.",5 out of 5 stars.
2093,Avene Thermal Spring Water 50ml - Mist for Sensitive skin,Linda K.,"[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Before testing this product out, I was kept sceptical. However, as someone who suffers from dry skin and eczema, I was pleasantly surprised with the results this spring water provided. It's almost an all-purpose skin spray; I used it before applying makeup and also on my dry skin. It's added hydration to my skin and is very soothing I would also say I was surprised by how big the 300mL was. I would, however, repurchase the smaller bottle just to keep in my handbag to refresh my face.",5 out of 5 stars.
2094,Avene Thermal Spring Water 50ml - Mist for Sensitive skin,Ping C.,[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] This spray was really easy and refreshing to use. The spring water comes out as a fine mist which was very cooling especially on hot days.I normally do suffer from dry skin and I felt that it did help to put the moisture back especially in the dry areas of my face.The 300mL bottle was a bit big to carry around but I do know it does come in the smaller sizes which would be handy to pop into my handbag.Overall I would recommend this product to everyone especially coming into the summer months where this would be a nice refreshing spray,5 out of 5 stars.

It's helped me so much especially with my dry sensitive skin, as it feels more hydrated, soothing and gives that added youthful healthy-looking glow after a couple of uses. Also, it has relived and lessened the visibility of skin irritation too. Now I've added it to my daily skin routine and have never looked back. Highly recommend this product.",5 out of 5 stars.
2096,Avene Thermal Spring Water 50ml - Mist for Sensitive skin,Lucy N.,[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I have been curious about Avène Thermal Spring Water for a while now but was skeptical of it's claims as it seemed like just water in a can. So I was pleasantly surprised by how it calmed down my dry patches and eczema. The mist is very fine and adds a luxurious boost of hydration to the skin. It it light and refreshing enough that it doesn't feel like it is weighing down my skin as the weather warms up.,5 out of 5 stars.
2097,Avene Thermal Spring Water 50ml - Mist for Sensitive skin,Erica D.,"[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Coming into summer I am so excited to use this. I have incorporated it into my every day routine from morning to night - it's great to spray over your face to wake up in the morning before applying serums and moisturisers, can be used throughout the day to refresh dull, dry looking make up without it shifting or sliding off, and before bed for a lasting hit of hydration before applying heavier creams.I also kept this in the fridge and used it on almost sunburnt skin and found it so hydrating and non sticky (unlike moisturisers/aloe gel).",5 out of 5 stars.
2098,Avene Thermal Spring Water 50ml - Mist for Sensitive skin,Joyce C.,"[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] The effects of this spray has really surprised me – it’s so soothing and refreshing, and really helps hydrate my otherwise dry and sensitive face.

2099,Avene Thermal Spring Water 50ml - Mist for Sensitive skin,Helen D.,"[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I love this refreshing spray! I guess it's hard to write a review and the number one thing that people wonder is &quot;do I need this?&quot; And if you're even considering buying this, I'm going to say yes and here's why...It's so versatile and refreshing!!!! There are just so many uses and I particularly loved the tip of popping it in the fridge for a cold mist. I must say, I particularly loved it after a beach visit to freshen up and prevent my face going crusty or salty from the beach! I love it as a base/first step for skincare as I find products get absorbed better when there is a little premoisture/hydration. I love it to refresh my makeup-spray a little at the end of the day and you feel fresher. Dab away any extra moisture and oil and you'll look as good as new! Whilst this product isn't an &quot;essential&quot; like say, an SPF or moisturiser, I think it is an essential in that once you have it you'll wonder how you did without it.",5 out of 5 stars.
2100,Avene Thermal Spring Water 50ml - Mist for Sensitive skin,Julia N.,[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] SUCH a refreshing product.

2101,Avene Thermal Spring Water 50ml - Mist for Sensitive skin,Talia C.,"[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] This water spray really surprised me! It was super hydrating and calming. I love to use this morning and night after cleansing for a smooth hydrated base before I apply my other skincare products. My sensitive skin had a reaction to another product, and after spraying this I definitely saw a visible improvement in the irritation and the redness completely went away. The spray is so refreshing, I love having this bottle on my bedside table to really wake me up in the morning or spray during the night to cool down. I can already tell this is going to be a staple for me in summer. Although the bottle is quite large, it’s easy to hold and use and you get a lot of product! The mist feels amazing and distributes the product perfectly across the face. This is definitely a product for people who want to treat themselves and add a luxurious extra step to their skincare routine!",5 out of 5 stars.
2102,Avene Thermal Spring Water 50ml - Mist for Sensitive skin,Tahlee A.,[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] This product does exactly what it sets out to do- hydrate and revitalise. Whilst trying out this product I tried it in a variety of ways:1. I have quite dry skin especially on my legs and in particular my shins. Applying this added moisture back and especially after going to the beach and being that bit salty! Great for summer!2. When applying make up it generally looks great straight away but can look a bit dried out- applying this added more of a glossy look and refreshed my make up.Overall I would definitely recommend this product.,5 out of 5 stars.
2103,Avene Thermal Spring Water 50ml - Mist for Sensitive skin,Soraya M.,"[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] This product is such a skincare staple!I always use this as a 'spritz' after cleansing, and before applying my serums (for added hydration). If I'm going to the beach, I also bring this along for an added hydrating spritz in summer. It's even more cooling if you store it in the fridge.I like the big bottle for home usage, the mini bottles are good for 'travel'. I didn't necessarily see any reduction in 'redness', however my usage of this product is primarily to 'refresh' the face and skin. I recommend this product for everyone of all ages.",5 out of 5 stars.
2104,Avene Thermal Spring Water 50ml - Mist for Sensitive skin,Natasha M.,"[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I surprisingly enjoyed trialling Avène’s Thermal Spring Water product. I have never used a mist such as this one before and found it very convenient on the go, especially after a run or exercising. It immediately soothes irritation and softens skin. The spray bottle is so convenient to use and I didn’t actually find the need to pat dry after a few minutes as it easily absorbed into skin. It can also be used throughout the day over makeup and doesn’t let it slide away. Would overall recommend this product.",5 out of 5 stars.
2105,Avene Thermal Spring Water 50ml - Mist for Sensitive skin,Andrea D.,"This is one of my must-have products. I have oily and sensitive skin that can flare up due to allergens in the air. Spritzing this on instantly calms my skin and is very soothing. I use this primarily as a toner after cleanser and before applying serum. I find this helps to prevent any flare ups, especially in spring during hayfever season. This is also great for travel and in the office when the air is quite dry. A single pump really helps to inject moisture back into the skin. The spray is a very fine mist that distributes evenly without dripping. I have a large can in the bathroom and the smaller travel-sized version in my bag. It might seem odd paying for water, but I find this really does have the soothing benefits and worth the money.",5 out of 5 stars.

2109,Avene Thermal Spring Water 50ml - Mist for Sensitive skin,Leonie C.,"I've been using this Thermal Spring Water for about a year now and love how refreshing it makes my skin feel, especially during those hot, sticky summer days.  The mist is so fine and only a short spritz or two is needed to cover my face.  I use the spray after showering each day and before applying my skincare products, and I find it fabulous for cooling down my face after a workout.  It has in the past relieved and healed the redness on my face after experiencing a reaction to some product I had used.  During the warmer months I use the spray at any time to refresh my skin.  I suppose it's just water in a can with added benefits but no matter what it is it is certainly soothing and comforting and makes my skin feel so refreshed.",4 out of 5 stars.
2110,Avene Thermal Spring Water 50ml - Mist for Sensitive skin,wendy m.,I brought this to spray on my face due having acne that was always angry looking. I sprayed it on my face everyday first thing in the morning and in a few days the acne wasnt as red and they looked better. I felt it made my face feel overall alot better and fresher. I have been using it every day since and feel my face feels and looks alot better. Its good also that my face never stings when I spray it on. So it would be good for peoples faces that are sensitive. Avene Thermal Spring water has become a product that I use in my beauty regime everyday and I couldnt be more impressed,4 out of 5 stars.
2111,Avene Thermal Spring Water 50ml - Mist for Sensitive skin,Vivien L.,[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I think this is a very cooling spray. especially when you are extremely dehydrated.

2113,Avene Thermal Spring Water 50ml - Mist for Sensitive skin,Eloise M.,[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Refreshing and hydrating all in one relaxing mist. I've been using the thermal water in the morning before and after I work out for hydration and a little freshen up. My skin feels plump and looks dewy and fresh even after I've just rolled out of bed. I always carry the mini bottle in my handbag whenever I travel as it gives your skin that little boost it needs! I didn't see any insane effects in the texture of my skin but I still absolutely love this product for refreshing and plumping up my skin during the day. I'm so excited for summer to roll around so I can get even more use out of this mist during humid days!,4 out of 5 stars.
2114,Avene Thermal Spring Water 50ml - Mist for Sensitive skin,Bridget L.,"[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] The Avene Thermal Sping Water Spray is perfect for summer!

The price of the product is reasonable, and I would purchase it again for the summer!",4 out of 5 stars.
2115,Avene Thermal Spring Water 50ml - Mist for Sensitive skin,Lily S.,[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Lovely product that I use over the cooler months. I have this on my desk and use it all day long. The mist is fine and the nozzle sprays  well. I'm not sure if it actually does anything for my skin though? It would be difficult to see visible results. I also like to use it before I apply oil so my face is slightly damp. I mainly use it to cool down. But I don't think I would use this purely for skin care benefits,4 out of 5 stars.
2116,Avene Thermal Spring Water 50ml - Mist for Sensitive skin,Shiren J.,"[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] This is a refreshing moisture boost, and very convenient to use. I use it through the day, after I have a cleaned my face and it does the job for me. Really good to use after you have come in from the sun! Its cooling and refreshing. It takes a while to evaporate from the skin, but one can get around that by not spraying on too much. I have combination skin that is prone to rashes. I find this product moisturizing and soothing.",4 out of 5 stars.
2117,Avene Thermal Spring Water 50ml - Mist for Sensitive skin,holaallyy,"I have gone through this about 4 times, and it adds moisture to your face before you apply moisturiser to your face. I used this in cohesion to the other Avene products and it has reduced redness and cleared some of my blemishes. You have to wait about a month until you actually see results though.",4 out of 5 stars.
2118,Avene Thermal Spring Water 50ml - Mist for Sensitive skin,Verlaine,"I had a smilar response to one of the other punters here, to the effect of ""why bother?"" Other facial spray mists I have used (hello old skool Jurlique) had helpful botanicals. My sample size was small and obviously wouldn't last long. In some ways I had no need to use it, in other ways its actual replacement cost was so exxy I felt obliged to save it for an occasion. For some reason I didn't use it in association with cycling, and can't recall why. I ended up in a super poorly insulated rental property, in a sweltering summer. The heat was murderous. I was using the more economical version of this, a generic plastic spray bottle with tap water. (I don't think I tried spring water).Eventually I remembered this sample, and have to admit in that context, compared to  squirting myself with a standard spray bottle, this was by contrast glorious. It's not just in the water, it's in the spray mist applicator. This delivers a very fine, cool, even, precise mist.  It doesn't turn you into a drowned rat with damp hair, and with water and possibly make up dripping off your face. It also got used up quite quickly. Sample size was possibly smaller than 50ml. At that time, the full priced larger cannisters seemed to be about $20 at CW which was out of the question. There was no way to refill the one I had. This is unlike the Jurlique reusable packaging, although the spray applicator's mist quality is superior. I'm not especially convinced the water has super special qualities. But like most spring water, it is pleasant relative to mains tap water.So, for people who may be trapped in hot buildings, cars or environments without air conditioning, people engaging in aerobic activities that induce sweating like cycling, and possibly for those experiencing conditions such as hot flushes, I think this spray could be useful. Therefore i recommend keeping an eye out for specials, including where it is supplied as a bonus extra to trial.

My dermatologist has me on injections to reduce my flair ups, but the one thing that wouldn't heal up was the skin around my eyes. I've tried everything. Recently I did some internet searches looking for solutions as I was tired of hydrocortisone and other meds. The XeraCalm popped up and I decided to try it due to the reviews. I was amazed to watch the skin around my eyes start to heal up within 3 days. For the first time, I finally felt like my skin looked normal and hydrated and healed! I decided to pick up the Tolerance cream [smaller bottle for redness - hopefully I got that right]and combined it with the first cream. I'd say my skin looks just about normal now. I asked my mom and she was stunned by the results. I don't know if it'll work for others like it did for me, but I'm a believer. I will definitely be a life time buyer of this product.

I was always eczema prone, even as a kid, but it wasn't until my mid-20s that I started getting it on my hands, and then I became a nurse, so I am sanitizing and washing my hands constantly, which makes it so much worse. This is the only over-the-counter product that actually helps my eczema, and I have tried hundreds of dollars worth of creams, oils, balms, etc. Even heavy duty prescription steroids always enough, and I ended up using a topical immunosuppressant for a while. With the xeracalm, I have only had to use the steroid cream maybe twice in the last 6 months, and I haven't needed the immunosuppressant ointment at all. It's also gentle enough to use on my face, and although rich, it did not exacerbate my occasional acne. I swear by this stuff.",5 out of 5 stars.

2231,Avene XeraCalm A.D Lipid-Replenishing Balm 400ml,Cal,"I have suffered from Eczema my whole life. From aveeno, cerave, cetaphil, topicals, and anything ""NEA Approved"", i've tried it all. I always see reviews from brands saying how ""it really works"" and I'm always skeptical because none of those products ever worked on me. For years, Kiehls baby moisturizer was a great product for moisture but not so much for addressing my eczema. So from someone with very VERY sensitive eczema prone skin, this REALLY works. The balm is soothing once you apply it on your body and also leaves some what of a sheen making you look dewy and smooth. I have been using this for about a month my and the texture of my skin is as smooth as a newly polished bowling ball. The redness has disappeared and I truly can not recommend this enough. Definitely consider this but of course, everyone's skin type is different so i would do some research.

First my tretinoin, followed by Avene tolerance balm. Sometimes I’ll mix it with the Avene cicalfate balm. I only use it at night because of the thicker texture. I also will use it on my neck when my skin has a breakout of eczema and it helps to quickly bring my skin back to normal within a couple days.

2318,Avene XeraCalm A.D Cleansing Oil 400ml - Cleanser for eczema-prone skin,Classic B.,"I was specifically looking for a gentle body wash to help moisturize and keep my skin stay moisturized in between the AHA/BHA and retinol body washes I will be starting. I did some research and this Avene Xeracalm A.D. Lipid Replenishing Cleansing Oil was listed as a top pick. I purchased it. It arrived on time. Honestly, with the first use as a body wash, I was confused. It did not lather like a soap and didn't leave me feeling super squeaky clean. I decided right away this was not the right body wash for me. Because it is listed as a cleansing oil I tried it as a face wash and WOW, I am LOVING IT. It is the only face wash I reach for day and night now. I started prescription tretinoin 7 weeks ago and am going through the purge cycle where my skin is experiencing temporary redness, peeling, irritation, and a few zits here and there. This cleansing oil is literally saving my face, cleaning, healing, and soothing my skin from the purge. I have been using the cleansing wash that came with my RX tretinoin, as well as Cerave face wash for sensitive skin. But none of them compares to this one. Avene’s XeraCalm A.D Lipid-Replenishing Cleansing Oil is amazing at removing skincare, sunscreen, makeup day and night. For an extra clean, I use it twice in a row to double cleanse. I never use a full pump. It’s more like a half pump so a little goes a long way. My skin is left feeling super clean, refreshed, super soft, super moisturized, and CALM. It’s how I prep my skin every night before my Tretinoin skincare routine as well as when I use my AHA/BHA serums and other skincare + makeup in the day. I am truly surprised and happy with this purchase and will continue to purchase this cleanser in the future. I love it so much I have recommended it to my mother and sisters. If you’re a rx tretinoin use like me you’re going to love what this cleansing oil can do for your skin.",5 out of 5 stars.

I always had backups, because I subscribed to monthly deliveries, sitting in my cabinet cause I couldn’t imagine not having it. Unfortunately the formula has changed and it’s not the same. It’s thinner, has a different scent and isn’t as gentle as it used to be. Sometimes its caused my skin to become red and inflamed. It’s really weird. It still removes makeup really easily and provides a truly cleansed face. I just wont use it as much as I used to. I’m currently using a bottle and have a back up on hand, but it’s just not what it used to be. I’ve had to use other cleansers to find something similar to the original formula.",3 out of 5 stars.

2502,Avene Tolerance CONTROL Soothing Skin Recovery Cream 40ml - Moisturiser for hypersensitive skin,J R.,"I really love this moisturizer. It not heavy, it’s truly fragrance free, and truly does calm my sensitive, reactive skin. When I wash my face at night and the redness is pronounced, I know that putting this moisturizer on will result in waking up with a calmed face. It works every time. It goes on beautifully when I dampen my skin with the thermal mist first, and only need one pump, maybe two, of this moisturizer to cover my entire face, throat, sides and back of neck, décolletage, and the backs of my hands. It absorbs really nicely, and works as a day cream and at night as a good moisturizer after washing and applying a serum.

My skin my irritated, red and itchy but I needed any form of moisture in my skin because while my current products at the time were irritating my sensitive skin, having extremely dry skin was also irritating me. Either way, I was irritated. When I stumbled upon the tolerance line, all I wanted was hydration and moisture in my skin that would not make me itch. I was not looking for a miracle. I was looking for something simple that could stabilize me even if it wasn’t my ideal moisturizer or moisturizing enough. When I first put the formula on my hands I could not imagine how it would be hydrating enough, but thought it would be good for what I needed so long as it didn’t irritate my skin. I was blown away, not only did this soothe my skin, it actually is really moisturizing and hydrating—way more than I expected for such a light formula. My skin feels so safe in this cream with so little ingredients. Why didn’t I try sooner?",5 out of 5 stars.

2770,Avene Tolerance CONTROL Soothing Skin Recovery Cream 40ml - Moisturiser for hypersensitive skin,kaga2023,"[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I had Avene tolerance control skin recovery cream to try and was quite impressed with it. I suffer from dry skin and occasionally it can make my skin feel tight and sore. I applied Avene and was surprised at how quick it worked. My skin felt soothed straight away and even after two applications my skin felt soft and smooth and moisturised. The cream is light to apply and soaks quickly into your skin. It is fragrance free and has the added bonus of no preservatives added to it. The tube has a pump applicator that makes it really easy to apply the right amount, and with the tight plastic lid that fits over it keeps the cream fresh and stops the pump drying out and becoming clogged. I also tried it on our 4 year old that suffers dry excema like skin and it reduced the redness straight away and he said it felt really nice on his skin. A great innovative cream that definitely soothed and calmed my dry skin so would recommend",4 out of 5 stars.

It is perfect for the skin after very hot days and very cold days. It is rich, but doesn't leave a residue after application on the skin, which is a problem with most other 'rich' formulae. I was really happy with the way my skin felt after using it. It doesn't have any fragrance, which is good for sensitive skin. The pump makes sure you don't contaminate the rest of the product, which I like. So happy customer overall.",4 out of 5 stars.

This means my face can feel tender and sore and become very tight. I tried various moisturisers but they only gave short lived relief. Avene Tolerance Control Soothing Recovery Cream was different; different because it treats my skin as a medic might. Almost instantly my skin felt more supple and clear.

I went to the dermo's to restock and they said they updated to this new skin recovery cream. The texture of the lotion was very different, the old one was a lot thicker. I gave it a try but after a couple uses my skin was peeling and dry, which never happened with the old one. I stuck through the dryness to give it a fair shot but after 2 weeks, I have formed these small bumps on my forehead. I think there is a new ingredient in it that is irritating my skin.

2812,Avene Tolerance CONTROL Soothing Skin Recovery Cream 40ml - Moisturiser for hypersensitive skin,Chanbee,[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I’m usually quite sceptical about using new products on my face so was a little hesitant at first but this cream was fine. It doesn’t have a scent and is smooth so feels really nice on your skin. The bottle is also nice with a small pump at the end.,2 out of 5 stars.
2813,Avene Tolerance CONTROL Soothing Skin Recovery Cream 40ml - Moisturiser for hypersensitive skin,Dina89,"[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Unfortunately I couldn't appreciate this face cream or see any results, as I used it twice so far. Didn't like it at all, I would say it's worst face cream I have ever used. After application, in 10-15 min face stink like used cooking oil. The smell so strong, can't get rid of it. My mistake, I used it before bed and some came onto my duver cover and pillow. Had to change bedding as couldn't sleep. Disappointed",2 out of 5 stars.
2814,Avene Tolerance CONTROL Soothing Skin Recovery Cream 40ml - Moisturiser for hypersensitive skin,Victoria,I was pretty excited to try this! I have been using solely skin recovery cream and they replaced it with this. It seems like this one isn’t as soothing. It definitely more oily and doesn’t really absorb well into my skin. I also feel like it has contributed to some breakouts. Unfortunately I’ll be looking for a new moisturizer and Avene won’t be it.,2 out of 5 stars.
2815,Avene Tolerance CONTROL Soothing Skin Recovery Cream 40ml - Moisturiser for hypersensitive skin,Tessa,"When I first purchased this product I really liked it! I have to use a lot of acne treatments and I naturally have dry, sensitive skin so was getting very irritated! This really helped! It did everything it said it would and then I noticed I was starting to get large, painful pimples. I hadn’t had breakouts like those in almost a year and was very surprised. I’ve mostly been dealing with texture and tone. I was looking at the ingredients for all my products and noticed that this was the only one that had ingredients that can clog pores. I did a little bit of research and learned that you’re practically guaranteed to breakout if you use these ingredients, even if you’re barely oily (like me). I really love avène and most of their products but I really wished that they would have directly indicated somewhere that this product can cause breakouts, especially because it says people with combination skin can use it. Sadly I can’t recommend this product due to this",2 out of 5 stars.
2816,Avene Tolerance CONTROL Soothing Skin Recovery Cream 40ml - Moisturiser for hypersensitive skin,Jay,"I have used this product religiously for years,I’m so upset about the reformulation.

2817,Avene Tolerance CONTROL Soothing Skin Recovery Cream 40ml - Moisturiser for hypersensitive skin,J.T,"I love the moisturizer and the new packaging is easier, I want to know why make it less product and price is same? Disappointed because I do like Avene products but this makes me feel like I should find an alternative. Going under 50 ML is ridiculous, product only lasted me a month at 50, now it will be under a month. Please do better, there are so many skin care lines available, from the past product people would mention they would like a bigger size, also for the ingredients not worth it.",2 out of 5 stars.
2818,Avene Tolerance CONTROL Soothing Skin Recovery Cream 40ml - Moisturiser for hypersensitive skin,SK,"The “improved” formula is terrible. It’s nowhere near as hydrating as the original tolerance/skin recovery cream. My skin feels tight and dry with this new formula, and it breaks me out. I never experienced that or any breakouts with the original. The tolerance emulsion was also a dream for sensitive skin! The formula was flawless, but this new moisturizer isn’t any good.",1 out of 5 stars.

I have sensitive skin, and although the discontinued Skin Recovery Cream worked really well for me, this new product was horrible. It was fine the first day but after a few days, I started to have red, irritated skin. I can't believe Avene is also discontinuing their Tolerance Extreme emulsion and cream too. Now Avene doesn't offer any products that work for me.",1 out of 5 stars.

After receiving and using the Tolerance Control, I discovered it is in NO WAY similar to the original Crème. The Tolerance was very thin and VERY drying. I have sensitive skin and the Tolerance made it worse! I usually love all the Avene products I have ever purchased. Very disappointed. I feel misled just to make a sale. Total waste of money!",1 out of 5 stars.

2828,Avene Tolerance CONTROL Soothing Skin Recovery Cream 40ml - Moisturiser for hypersensitive skin,Chicago,"I have extremely sensitive skin and I also have large ores, so my skin is oily and gets clogged easily. The only moisturizer that I found that didn’t break me out was suddenly discontinued after I had been using it for 15 years. After a year of trying new products to replace, I finally found Aveeno Tolerance Emulsion. It hydrated my skin without causing breakouts and without making me oily- I was so relieved! I used it for a couple of months and then one day when I went to reorder, I found that it had been discontinued as well. Tolerance Control was recommended as an alternative, so o tried it. Started using it two weeks ago and my skin is completely broken out. I’m so disappointed and furious that the Tolerance Emulsion was discontinued. Why do these companies keep discontinuing products that have a loyal base of customers who use it religiously? It makes no sense- like they’re just creating new products for excitement annd retiring old ones for no good reason. I’m really disappointed with this experience abd not sure what I think about a company that just discontinues products without reason.",1 out of 5 stars.
2829,Avene Tolerance CONTROL Soothing Skin Recovery Cream 40ml - Moisturiser for hypersensitive skin,Aimee,This is not for reactive rosacea intolerant skin Made my face burn..

2830,Avene Tolerance CONTROL Soothing Skin Recovery Cream 40ml - Moisturiser for hypersensitive skin,Sarah,This new line is NOT like the Extreme Emulsion.

2831,Avene Tolerance CONTROL Soothing Skin Recovery Cream 40ml - Moisturiser for hypersensitive skin,Sarah H.,After the Tolerance Extreme Emulsion was discontinued I bought this as it was suggested as a substitute and deeply regret the purchase.

After 2 weeks my entire face broke out in deep cystic acne (this was the only thing that changed in my routine) and I am so upset the extreme emulsion was discontinued.,1 out of 5 stars.
2832,Avene Tolerance CONTROL Soothing Skin Recovery Cream 40ml - Moisturiser for hypersensitive skin,Katie,"This product contains ethylhexyl palmitate, which is pore clogging.

2833,Avene Tolerance CONTROL Soothing Skin Recovery Cream 40ml - Moisturiser for hypersensitive skin,Isa,"I was sad to find out that the Tolérance Extrême Emulsion Light was out of stock (now discontinued) so I ordered this. The tolérance Extrême Emulsion light was the only moisturizer that has ever worked for my skin type (combination, allergy/sensitive) and this cream does not compare to that whatsoever. It somehow makes my face oily and dry at the same time and has caused me to break out in my t zone which is the exact problem I had with their ""heavier"" creams. I hope they bring back the Tolérance Extrême Emulsion light cream!!! My skin could only handle the 6 ingredients in that one but if you have less allergic skin or different skin the other reviews say this works well.",1 out of 5 stars.

I have rosacea, sensitive skin, and acne, as well as aging concerns. When I found the Avene Skin Recovery Cream, it was the best product I had ever used on my face. Not sure why they discontinued it, but I am not pleased. I ordered this Tolerance Skin Recovery Cream, hoping to have similar results - wrong. Within the first week of use, my skin broke out terribly. I have pimples where I never had them before on my face and they won't go away. My rosacea also flared up on my cheeks. I'm really displeased with this product and Avene has likely lost me as a customer after this change. For lovers of the original Skin Recovery Cream - this is not comparable.",1 out of 5 stars.

2857,Avene Tolerance CONTROL Soothing Skin Recovery Cream 40ml - Moisturiser for hypersensitive skin,Dana,"I have used the skin recovery cream for over two years after a major skin freak out. The texture of the prior dream was light, but effective and almost acted like a primer under my make up.it was discontinued so I tried this cream which is the replacement. Immediately I noticed the texture was thicker, almost pasty, and harder the spread. It felt heavier and I noticed pilling as I applied my makeup and it seemed to magnify my pores. For reference, I am 66, used to have combo skin, but it is now dry and sensitive. I have used several Avene products over the last couple of years, but this one is a disappointment. I see they have added beeswax, so maybe that is responsible for the thick texture and pilling. I also had a few pimples after using. Sorry, Avene, but this change was a fail.",1 out of 5 stars.

It’s non-greasy, light and creamy, and 40-min water resistant is a great length of time. I find that with other water-resistant sunscreens, I come out of the shower feeling greasy and sunscreen slapped because it still sticks to my skin! Avene balances sun protection and water resistance well - feels like a moisturiser! The pump also gives it a more premium cosmetics feel which is nice, great product!",5 out of 5 stars.

3007,Avene Sunscreen Emulsion Face SPF 50+ 50ml - For Sensitive Skin,Anne F.,"Firstly, I have to say I am so glad that there's a lot more choice of high protection sunscreen now and that sunscreens with an SPF50 + are the norm. Of course there is a lot of variation in quality and texture also, but Eau Thermale Avene is well-known for their skincare, so I was happy to try this emulsion when I first saw it. I was looking for good coverage with a matte consistency to wear under make-up and no white caste.  The sunscreen has a pump applicator, is light and easy to apply and covers my whole face and neck with one quick application. It gives a nice matte, non-shiny appearance and goes so nicely under make-up. It does unfortunately show a very light white caste but this can easily be blended in. The  scent is  quite mild, rather like skincare, which is another plus for me. Avene do make it easy to incorporate sunscreen into your skin routine. The slight white caste that requires more blending is the only drawback, and I do prefer Avene's  Tinted Cream for this reason - hence only 4 stars. Still a good product I will repurchase.",4 out of 5 stars.
3008,Avene Sunscreen Emulsion Face SPF 50+ 50ml - For Sensitive Skin,Mona106,I love the way this product blends with my skin and with my make up. It does not feel greasy or heavy. It has a very subtle fragrance and it does not irritate my sensitivity skin.,4 out of 5 stars.

3064,Avene Sunscreen Emulsion Face SPF 50+ 50ml - For Sensitive Skin,Fiona C.,"I had high expectations of this face sunscreen as it was from a reputable french brand. It contains a mix of physical (titanium dioxide) and chemical filters (Octocylene, Methylene Bis-Benzotriazolyl, Tetramethylbutylphenol). and water resistance of 40 minutes. I have a light skin tone and it looks ok on me even though I can tell that there is a slight white cast. This may be a problem for darker skin tones.It does have quite a strong fragrance that reminds me of the Nivea's Shine Control face sunscreen. The texture is light and non-greasy, and it absorbs and dries down quite well. It doesn't cause make-up to pull. However, I find that it does have a slight stickiness to it and in the middle of a hot day, my face does become oily.It's not the most elegant face sunscreen that I've used. There are better and cheaper face sunscreens like Cancer Council matte or Natio Daily defence that are made in Australia. Not a repurchase for me.",3 out of 5 stars.

3219,Avene Cleansing Foam 150ml,suzy68,"I've used foaming cleansers like this before and not been overly impressed, but the Avene foaming cleanser is a total game changer!! For a start the smell is just divine (it smells like the ocean) and the product itself is so soothing and gentle, but at the same time I can feel it removing every bit of caked on make up so easily. It leaves my skin feeling soft and hydrated and not one bit dry. I actually enjoy washing my skin now and will never buy any other cleanser!! AMAZING PRODUCT!",5 out of 5 stars.

3224,Avene Cleansing Foam 150ml,Joli3n,This product creates a nice foam and deep cleanses my skin rapidly. It smells fresh and clean and is a bit astringent like it tones as well as cleans. It removed make up properly without streaking.,5 out of 5 stars.
3225,Avene Cleansing Foam 150ml,Katalinks,One pump creates a nice fluffy ball of white mouse - which is more than enough to create a good lather all over the face and decolletage. The smell is pleasantly fresh. And it feels quite moisturising - so I don't have to bolt to get moisturiser on before my face cracks. Plus my ultra white face towel is crystal clean when drying (after removing makeup). So it rates highly on the deep cleansing front.A nice cleansing product!,5 out of 5 stars.

I have already recommended it to a friend who has sensitive acne prone skin like mine. I have used so many cleansers that claim to be gentle yet effective and I have never found one that actually did what it said until this one!!! I found Avéne through my new dermatologist and I am so thankful. They are so affordable which makes it even better! I am angry at the prices I’ve paid for things that have only harmed my skin.

3235,Avene Cleansing Foam 150ml,Anne F.,"This super easy-to-use cleansing foam is another staple from the Eau Thermale range. A very gentle no-nonsense cleanser with virtually no scent, it is perfect for my son who has combination skin with dry patches as well as breakouts, and sensitive skin prone to redness. I recommended it to him when he was reacting to some aggressive products which were supposed to rid his skin of impurities and it has really helped him. Although it would not be a prolonged choice for a dry complexion (mine), I do use it sometimes without any problems. It rinses off so easily but without that  squeaky clean feeling that you just know will leave your skin dry and taut. Unusually, it actually lives up to its claim to be safe for use on eye makeup - I have rarely found this even in dedicated eye makeup removers, but it is absolutely true. I would still double cleanse heavy makeup ( a hard habit to break) but for ordinary days it does the trick, and I would recommend this to most skin types except very dry.Nice to have a product that can keep most of the family happy!",5 out of 5 stars.
3236,Avene Cleansing Foam 150ml,Alanna,"I absolutely love this cleanser, please make an un-scented version! Melts the makeup off, leaves skin feeling clean, soft, and not stripped.

3237,Avene Cleansing Foam 150ml,Debbie G.,I’m loving this cleansing foam. Especially with my sensitive skin. It’s just perfect. My face is totally clean after using the foaming cleanser because I use a pad with micellar water and it ALWAYS comes out clean!,5 out of 5 stars.

It doesn't make my skin feel tight or stripped at all which is great. 1 or 2 pumps is all you really need to wash your face and neck. It rinses off really easily and doesn't leave my skin with any sort of film on it. This cleanser does remove light makeup and sunscreen residue/grease.

3274,Avene Cleansing Foam 150ml,Beth_AlmostPosh,"I'm from the ""if it foams, it's working"" school of cleanser use and this cleanser foams up beautifully from the wide angle nozzle. The feel is silky and soft, rinsing easily for skin that feels clean without stripping. This is a great product as a first or second cleanse and good value as it performs as well as more expensive cleansers. Scent is slightly baby powderish which is the only thing stopping me from giving 5 stars. I was kindly gifted this product for review.",4 out of 5 stars.
3275,Avene Cleansing Foam 150ml,jackel,I love this foam cleanser and it is a nice smell to it and when using the pump it gives you just enough  product to clean your face with.  My skin feels refreshed and soft and it works well after using the sleeping mask,4 out of 5 stars.
3276,Avene Cleansing Foam 150ml,purplesp8y,"I've been using the Avene Cleansing Foam for just over 2 weeks every morning. My first thoughts were that it was just airy foam that couldn't possible do anything but I was wrong. It definitely left my skin feeling clean and hydrated, no drying out tightness. I like the easy to use pump, just one squirt did my whole face. The pack seems to be lasting a long time. I preferred using it on wet skin. My only negativity was the smell that first hits you when it goes on but that only lasts a second or two, some may call it a refreshing scent but for me it was a bit too powerful for a cleanser. A bit on the expensive side so try and buy when on special.",4 out of 5 stars.

3287,Avene Cleansing Foam 150ml,PATRICIA R.,"it cleanses deeper than the Tolerance Gentle, so I use this to remove makeup or sunscreen if needed.

Much to my surprise, my skin flared up terribly after using it. I got inflamed bumps all over my face and it only subsided after I gave up using this cleanser for a week. It removes dirt and grime on the skin well, but my skin constantly felt dry no matter how much moisturizer I applied. My skin’s bad reaction to the cleanser might be why my skin felt excessively dry and rough all the time.If you’re someone who has sensitive skin that can handle parfum in a product, then I would recommend it. If not, avoid this cleanser.",1 out of 5 stars.

Start with the moisturising spray to clean your skin, add the super light serum and finish with the lovely rich moisturiser. Particularly interesting is that the serum offers longer lasting results than hydraulic acid which is the main advantage of the skincare brand I have been using for the past couple of years.  After just a few days my skin feels softer, plumper and smoother. If I had one criticism it's that I would have liked a less perfumed smelling scent and maybe some SP25 in the moisturiser but I will definitely be buying this product again!",5 out of 5 stars.

3369,Avene Hydrance Rich Hydrating Cream 40ml - Moisturiser for dehydrated skin,Marks71,"[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] An eye-catching pack with three products that were neatly presented inside. I loved the three step routine that was quick and easy to incorporate into my morning and evening. The pack contains three products and the back of the pack easily explains which order to do each one. The soothing spray left my skin feeling refreshed, invigorated and calm and a perfect amount sprays out each time. The serum is lovely: the pump is easy to use and it dispenses an ideal amount with each pump. It had a light, creamy fragrance and it gave my skin an effective barrier against the day and provided a smooth base for the moisturiser. The moisturiser was nourishing, smelt pleasant and was lightweight and easily absorbed. My skin has felt great since using the three products and I’d be happy to recommend to others and will continue to use them.",5 out of 5 stars.

My skin is very dry and dehydrated - no amount of moisturiser or serum’s help! After using this kit religiously for the last 3 weeks I can say my skin feels amazing! I use the Micellar cream to remove my make up and it does the job effectively! Then I apply the Hydrance Intense Serum and it’s so lightweight, not sticky at all and super hydrating. I follow up with the Hydrance Rich Hydrating Cream which is a rich moisturiser but feels lightweight and soaks up into my skin super fast. My skin feels soft, smooth and very hydrated! Love this kit and will be using this as part of my daily routine from now!",5 out of 5 stars.

The spray makes your skin feel clean, followed by the rehydrating serum, which locks in the water, plumps up the skin, and makes some wrinkles fade. It soaks in well and doesn’t make your skin greasy. The moisturiser that goes on top makes a good base for makeup, feels like a good barrier against great british weather.

3451,Avene Hydrance Rich Hydrating Cream 40ml - Moisturiser for dehydrated skin,Jtog59,"[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] This is an excellent, expert skincare routine that replenishes moisture to all types of dehydrated sensitive skin for up to 24 hours.  The routine is very simple but the results are superb.   The first step is to cleanse the face with the thermal spring water to sooth, freshen and balance PH levels on the skin.  Next, I apply the serum onto the face and neck to rehydrate and smooth the appearance of fine lines.  Lastly I moisturise with the rich hydrating cream for a smooth finish.   My skin looks and feels great.  No wonder it has been recommended by dermatologists.  This is the first time I have used an Avene product but it will not be the last.  A great routine that I will be using in the future.",4 out of 5 stars.

3457,Avene Hydrance Rich Hydrating Cream 40ml - Moisturiser for dehydrated skin,Leah S.,I've used this product in the past and loved it. The last tube I received started pilling when I applied it with other Avene and non-Avene products. Hopefully it's just a one off and it won't happen again.,3 out of 5 stars.
3458,Avene Hydrance Rich Hydrating Cream 40ml - Moisturiser for dehydrated skin,Candace S.,I think that you changed the formula from what is was when it was in a jar instead of a tube.

The moisturiser is very thick and a little goes a long way, it doesn't make your evening kin greasy and asorbs nicely, having been using these products for a month I have found my skin is soft and plump, although I have to say I didn't find any reduction in my fine lines and wrinkles. As a moisturizer I would recommend this product.",3 out of 5 stars.
3462,Avene Hydrance Rich Hydrating Cream 40ml - Moisturiser for dehydrated skin,Skye S.,I had a sample of this and liked it for how moisturizing it was on my dry face so ordered the full size. It is very moisturizing which I like but it pills like crazy whenever I touch my face after it’s on. All I do is wash my face and then apply. No serums or anything under that would make it pill. Even just putting concealer or bronzer on it pills and rubs off my face. I don’t plan on repurchasing since half the time I apply some sort of concealer or sunscreen and just can’t get past the pilling.,3 out of 5 stars.

3466,Avene Hydrance Rich Hydrating Cream 40ml - Moisturiser for dehydrated skin,Rosemary S.,"I love that it’s so gentle particularly for my dry SENSITIVE skin. However, I wish it were a bit richer and creamier. It’s just more of a texture thing rather than the product itself.",3 out of 5 stars.

I knew it might not work for me when I first noticed how fragrant it was. I put the moisturizer on and after a few minutes, noticed my cheeks were bright red. My skin wasn't burning or hurting, but my cheeks were red and a bit warm to the touch. I had to wash it off.

It is rich, ultra hydrating, thick and goes on smoothly. The winters are long and drying in New England. I wanted this as my everyday, go-to moisturizer. The moment I opened it and caught wind of the scent was my usual ""oh, no..."". I absolutely detest the signature scent of AVENE (yet I love the product!). It is strong, it lingers and frequently can be irritating. Why would company that is know for making products for people with sensitive skin use a horrible fragrance? It is a bitter/floral/old-lady cheap perfume scent. Horrible. I could live with a scent which was subtle, did not linger and fresh. Please consider remaking your signature scent.",1 out of 5 stars.

I began using Avene Xeracalm products about 4 years ago, and still used them every day for the body, however, Tolerance Extremely Gentle Cleanser has revolutionized my facial skin. I use it exclusively, and it feels wonderful, does not create sensitivity nor redness, and has settled my occasional breakouts down to just a few per month.

3502,Avene Tolerance Extremely Gentle Cleanser 200ml - Cleanser for hypersensitive skin,Ashley R.,"My skin is extremely reactive lately. I am acne-prone and my dermatologist has me on a benzoyl peroxide/clindamycin topical in the morning and a tretinoin topical at night. This combination (particularly in the mornings) can cause a lot of stinging, burning, itching, and discomfort after cleansing and applying the topical, and that's before I apply my moisturizer. I have to use moisturizer due to the drying nature of the medications, and I absolutely must use sunscreen. The problem has been that IT HURTS! I've only used this cleanser twice so far, once last night prior to my tretinoin, and once this morning prior to my bzp/clin topical. So far, I am IN LOVE! The morning medication didn't burn and make me want to rip my skin off. The real moment of truth was the moisturizer, though. I'm using the tolerance balm and I was prepared for my usual extreme discomfort, but guess what? NOTHING! It doesn't burn, itch, sting, or hurt. My face feels moisturized and comfortable. I am so thrilled I found this skincare line by total accident. I love my Cetaphil, but even that hasn't cut it with these topical medications. Maybe now I'll actually keep up on the daily routine with my topicals since I don't have to choose between painful, clearer skin and a face riddled with breakouts.",5 out of 5 stars.

I'm still working on figuring out the right amount of lotion I need to clean my face, but I love how this product feels on my skin. It hasn't made my skin dry or red and whether it's the formula or the ability of the product to help me stick to a routine, my acne has dramatically cleared up.

3619,Avene Tolerance Extremely Gentle Cleanser 200ml - Cleanser for hypersensitive skin,Karan13,I received this product as a product trial and have decided to add it to my regular skin care routine. The container is easy to hold and the flip top Lynn is very convenient. The product is unscented and leaves my skin feeling Clean & fresh but it doesn't strip the natural oils from my skin. The directions say that there's no need to wash it off but I don't feel comfortable leaving cleanser and the grime it is supposed to remove on my skin so I wash it off with water. I find that it leaves no uncomfortable residue on my skin.,5 out of 5 stars.

3634,Avene Tolerance Extremely Gentle Cleanser 200ml - Cleanser for hypersensitive skin,JWinsor,"[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] After a nasty skin flare-up on my face, neck and chest (caused, perhaps, by the use of retinol), I decided to go right back to basics and, after a little research, decided on Avene, which is infused with spring water and has a good reputation for dealing with skin sensitivities. I use the Tolerance Extreme Cleansing Lotion (gently massaging into the skin with my fingers) and remove it with a pad soaked in Avene Thermal Spring Water; I then spray my entire face, neck and chest with the Spring Water and, when that has soaked in, I use Avene Tolerance Extreme Creme Riche for my moisturising step. Over the past couple of weeks, having stopped my usual serums etc and having used only Avene products, my skin is now looking much better and feels calm, soothed and moisturised. Although I will, no doubt, gradually want to return to using some of the more active products I was using before the flare-up, I'm very happy now with my skin and intend to continue using the Avene cleansing, toning and moisturising steps as part of my regular skincare routine.",5 out of 5 stars.

3668,Avene Tolerance Extremely Gentle Cleanser 200ml - Cleanser for hypersensitive skin,FrenchPoodle,"From what I can tell this is a re-packaging of Avene's old Extremely Gentle Cleansing milk that came in a transparent bottle with a flip top. It is a viscous skim-milk type consistency and the new bottle is more appealing & securely closes.It gives the same super gentle cleansing -- never burns eyes or leaves a greasy film, has no smell or anything irritating. I sometimes wear tinted SPF but otherwise wear no make-up so I can only attest to its efficacy in removing tinted SPF: it takes a couple of applications. I apply this cleanser with my fingertips & massage in for one minute then rinse off with a wet pima cotton flannel face cloth that is super gentle & I have no problems with this method: no redness, no nothing. It's not an exciting cleanser but it checks all my boxes: no fragrance, no essential oils, wipe off, etc.",5 out of 5 stars.

So far my face likes it for the sensitivity and its way less drying. I am still getting some breakouts but not as bad. I also don't turn bright red or burn when I use it, so that's super nice. give it a 4 because it's a keeper but I am also not like 'OMG MY FACE IS AMAZING!' To me that would be a 5. :) I wish there were more instructions on the bottle, though. I am unsure if I'm supposed to wipe away the cream to clean or just massage it in and leave it to clean? I've been doing both with equal results, just wish I had a bit more info on the bottle.",4 out of 5 stars.

The Avene Tolerance Extremely Gentle Cleanser is applied with your fingertips and you then remove the remaining residue with a cotton pad.

This cleanser has a gel-lotion texture that’s slightly thicker than water which is creamy and soft to apply. It is fragrance free and does not contain any chemicals. When using the Avene Tolerance Extremely Gentle Cleanser, I had no irritation, no reaction and no discomfort. It definitely made my skin feel calm and less prone to showing any signs of stress. The Avene Extremely Gentle Cleanser is a lovely, gentle cleanser which is very efficient a removing makeup and daily grime.",4 out of 5 stars.

3691,Avene Tolerance Extremely Gentle Cleanser 200ml - Cleanser for hypersensitive skin,Anonymous,"This is a really nice cleanser if you have super sensitive skin. I didn’t have any reactions like I tend to do to a lot of other cleansers but I also didn’t find it worked all that well for me if I was wearing makeup, sunscreen that day. It was nice to use as a second cleanser in those instances.",4 out of 5 stars.

3693,Avene Tolerance Extremely Gentle Cleanser 200ml - Cleanser for hypersensitive skin,Rosalind21,"I am not usually a huge fan of milk/lotion cleansers, however, I was pleasantly surprised at how much I ended up loving this cleanser! My skin was quite sensitive and had some breakouts when I was using this Avene Tolerance Extremely Gentle Cleanser but it not only does not irritate my sensitive skin, I feel like it also helped to strengthen my skin barrier. Even though it claims to be a no-rinse formula, I still prefer to wash it off like a normal cleanser. Nevertheless, it never leaves my skin feeling tight or dry at all after cleansing despite being a relatively effective cleanser. I don't find it sufficient to remove makeup but I love using it as the second step (after using a cleansing balm). I also love that it does not leave any residue after cleansing, which is what I usually dislike about milk/lotion cleansers. I would easily recommend this to anyone, especially to those looking for a gentle, effective lotion cleanser and those with sensitive skin types.",4 out of 5 stars.
3694,Avene Tolerance Extremely Gentle Cleanser 200ml - Cleanser for hypersensitive skin,Caillyn4,"I love using this cleanser in the shower, or if my skin is feeling extra sensitive then I leave it on and it absorbs.

3697,Avene Tolerance Extremely Gentle Cleanser 200ml - Cleanser for hypersensitive skin,RhyW,This cleanser is great for my normal to sensitive skin. It is extremely gentle and leaves my skin feeling super soft and clean without drying it out. It was not strong enough to remove makeup in one cleanse though so would recommend using a makeup remover or stronger cleanser first if you are double cleansing.,4 out of 5 stars.
3698,Avene Tolerance Extremely Gentle Cleanser 200ml - Cleanser for hypersensitive skin,Irish Carol,"Initially the lotion seemed too light to take my make off and cleanse my skin, it glided on so gently and cleaned my skin and make up off with harsh feeling or look after cleansing, you do need a little more lotion for full make up, but that is to be expected and with the cleansing job done and my combination skin not raw afterwards my skin and I are winning.",4 out of 5 stars.

It made my skin feel nourished and hydrated and not stripped like other cleansers do. The instructions were a little unclear at first and I wasn’t sure if I left on the skin or removed so if this could be improved then it would be 5 stars for me.,4 out of 5 stars.
3705,Avene Tolerance Extremely Gentle Cleanser 200ml - Cleanser for hypersensitive skin,katie5283,"This cleanser is super gentle, which is great for sensitive skin but I found I had to do multiple washes using it when I was wearing makeup to effectively remove mascara and bb cream as well as feel like I was cleaning the skin. On days I wasn't wearing make up it felt nice as I had no reaction to the product at all but it still left me feeling clean. Overall I think the product is probably good after you have wiped away any makeup, and it worked better when I used my cloth.",4 out of 5 stars.

3714,Avene Tolerance Extremely Gentle Cleanser 200ml - Cleanser for hypersensitive skin,Wolfbiker,"I really love Avène products . This cleanser is lovely. Simple , no scents and takes makeup off easily. Will break down waterproof mascara with a few gentle rubs of they eyes no harsh scrubbing involved. Although it does say you don’t have to wash it off .. for me that’s no idea because it’s breaking all my make up down and then leaving it on the skin so I would recommend washing your face after you use this. It does say in the description to use another one of their products to wipe it off so just a heads up maybe don’t leave it on your skin unless you have no make up on and just want a light cleanse.",4 out of 5 stars.
3715,Avene Tolerance Extremely Gentle Cleanser 200ml - Cleanser for hypersensitive skin,CLS1991,Great for my sensitive skin & my husband loves it too.

3722,Avene Tolerance Extremely Gentle Cleanser 200ml - Cleanser for hypersensitive skin,moonlightsak,"I love the cooling gel formula of this cleanser. the wipe off formula is great for removing makeup without irritating your skin. It is fragrance free and leaves your skin really soft and fresh. It is a non rinsing formula so great for the convenience when you just want to cleanse your face and too tired to wash your face in the bathroom. I like to use it with a reusable makeup remover pad.I also love using this a day or two after my skin needling sessions. As skin needling leaves my skin little raw and sensitive, this formula helps because it is gentle and does not sting my face.",4 out of 5 stars.
3723,Avene Tolerance Extremely Gentle Cleanser 200ml - Cleanser for hypersensitive skin,NB213,"I really enjoyed the experience of using this, it's completely fragrance free and works wonders to soothe my dry irritated skin. It's a really nice consistency and doesn't leave my skin feeling dry and tight after use in comparison to other brands. The ingredients list is so small which is a refreshing point of difference! It does state that it removes make up, but it didn't really do the best job at this. I found myself having to cleanse multiple times, or use a different cleanser to get all my make up off which is slightly disappointing. So I used it on no make up days to avoid this",4 out of 5 stars.

I found this cleanser has not irritated my eyes or skin and also does a very good job of removing make up. I use this as the first step of a double cleanse, the second step being a foaming wash, and i find this gel formula really does remove the bulk of the make up. A little also goes a long way with this product. Really pleased with it and would recommend for those with sensitive skin and want an effective make up remover.",4 out of 5 stars.

It's great for sensitive skin and is very gentle. I use it both morning and evening as a cleanser and make up remover. What's great about it is that it doesn't need washing off. It leaves my skin feeling soft, supple, hydrated and deeply cleansed. It's really lightweight in texture but is a little bit runny; however it doesn't leave a greasy residue. It effectively removes all my make up, which is what makes it so unique! Just cleanse and go, no water required! A must try!",4 out of 5 stars.

3738,Avene Tolerance Extremely Gentle Cleanser 200ml - Cleanser for hypersensitive skin,JuicyJ,"I received this product as part of a promotion and it's an extremely gentle cleanser for sensitive skin. Since it's very gentle, it doesn't foam unlike other cleansers and the instructions say it's a no-rinse formula.I prefer to wash my face in the shower so I used it like a normal cleanser - lathered and then rinsed. I never tried this water-free with just a cotton pad and then wiping the cleanser off.I found after using the cleanser, my face wasn't as red and flushed as it normally is which is good. I think it really lives up to its feature of being extremely gentle.I don't know if this cleanser would be good at removing any foundation on the face though. I feel it would be too gentle and a cleanser with make-up removing properties would be better suited.After using this cleanser for over a week, I personally wouldn't buy it as I don't require a cleanser that's this gentle but would recommend it if someone has sensitive and irritable skin.",3 out of 5 stars.
3739,Avene Tolerance Extremely Gentle Cleanser 200ml - Cleanser for hypersensitive skin,ShellLeigh,Whilst I love the Avene products I am not a fan of the Avene Tolerance Extremely Gentle Cleanser.

3740,Avene Tolerance Extremely Gentle Cleanser 200ml - Cleanser for hypersensitive skin,Amanda,"This cleanser is okay for a morning cleanse, or an evening cleanse when I'm not wearing makeup. However, it doesn't remove makeup - and I'm not talking waterproof stuff, I'm talking a very light layer of foundation. I had to cleanse *four* times to remove all of my foundation, which made my skin angry and raw - completely defeating the purpose of using a gentle product. And again - it was a light layer of foundation that hadn't been set with powder, and no other makeup. If the brand hadn't claimed it would remove makeup, that would be one thing, but it's right there on the bottle. Because of this, I won't repurchase. I recommend it only for use without makeup or in conjunction with another cleanser.",3 out of 5 stars.

The formula feels more watery and less moisturizing. It also has an odd smell, not fragrance, but it isn’t odorless like the previous formula. As a side note: Avene’s auto ship program is the worst. I wasn’t even notified when the old formula was discontinued and I’ve had multiple orders just not get shipped.",3 out of 5 stars.

3850,Avene Cleanance Comedomed Anti-Blemishes Concentrate 30ml - Acne moisturiser,Maria T.,"I decided after Accutane to branch out and get some new skincare products since your skin starts becoming a bit more oily after coming off the medication. I bought the cleanser, and the blemish control serum to see how my skin gets on with them. About a month after stopping my medication I started using these products. So far my skin LOVES them, for those of you who don't know Accutane is a strong acne medication that makes your skin EXTREMELY sensitive. However, this serum did not irritate my skin what so ever and it is quite remarkable considering I was one-month post-Accutane 60/80g. This serum helped control my oil without drying out my whole face, and although it is not meant to treat pimples it did help some underskin ones. The packaging is great for traveling and the pump is nice. I think all of their products look great, and if anyone is concerned about skin tolerance this product does not feel acid-like, unlike other products. Overall, I think it is worth a try for anyone with acne and I can see this totally being used in combination with other acne medication because it is not irritating.",5 out of 5 stars.

3864,Avene Cleanance Comedomed Anti-Blemishes Concentrate 30ml - Acne moisturiser,Kecrisalco,"Had to drop in and leave a 5 star review because I'm amazed by the results. I'm 28 and have oily, acne-prone skin and I get hormonal acne around my chin and jawline, so I've tried my fair share of acne products. I initially bought this because of the affordable price, and now that I'm using it I must say I am thoroughly impressed with this serum. I apply it 2 to 3 times a day after cleansing with the la roche-posay effaclar cleanser. It worked overnight to reduce my cystic acne and whiteheads. After the first night I tried it, I woke up the next morning and felt my chin and was shocked that I didn't feel any bumps. Treating acne takes patience, and this serum works so quickly, effectively, and reliably for me that it takes the stress out of the process. I typically use it all over my face, but I use it as a spot treatment, too. Plus it's much more affordable than the spot treatments I've been using. I will definitely be repurchasing this.",5 out of 5 stars.

Anyways, I have tried so many different treatments and products and none had been really effective or they either irritated my dry sensitive skin, making it worse. Well, I have been using this small size sample at night right before bedtime, and I'm really surprised with how effective and gentle it is! I was able to actually see a difference in the redness from my blemishes and acne actually being reduced and improving! This serum makes my face feel smoother, softer, and look healthier with a radiant glow! The only downside is that it has a strong medicinal scent, but it dissipates quickly after rubbing it into your skin. I like how it doesn't have any harsh chemicals, doesn't burn, it has plant based extracts, and is made with Avene Thermal Spring Water. Overall, I'm more than pleased with this serum results, recommend it, and plan to purchase a full size when I'm able to.",5 out of 5 stars.

When my hormones are a little wacky I also tend to see acne on my jaw line. It was perfect when I received a sample of Avené‘s cleanance concentrate blemish serum from sugar pop in exchange for my honest review. This concentrate blemish serum is formulated without harsh ingredients, plant based extracts, & Avène Thermal Spring Water. This serum is designed to help reduce excess oil & the appearance of blemishes with results available in as soon as 7 days. The serum itself is thick, creamy, & opaque white with a strong scent of alcohol (which is the second ingredient on the list so keep that in mind). I received only a small foil sample of this serum so I was able to use it three times as a spot treatment. I noticed that after applying this once a day for three days that two of the pimples I had developed on the underside of my jawline had visibly shrunken & were beginning to heal. Since I had only a small amount of this to try I wasn’t able to try this all over my face so I can’t yet report if it reduced oiliness or preventative acne capability. I also noticed it left a slightly sticky film. I didn’t experience any reactions or sensitivity when using this. Overall I’m really happy with this serum & would love to purchase a full size & see how this serum does with levels of oiliness.",5 out of 5 stars.

Her blemishes had gone down in size and the redness had been reduced. It left her skin feeling smoother and moisturized.

I’ve used so many acne products and spot treatments that burned and stung my skin, but this Blemish Control Serum just felt nourishing as I applied it. The scent is quite pungent, but the packaging warns you that it doesn’t affect the efficiency of the serum, it’s simply due to the thermal water as a main ingredient.

This product went on smooth and I didn't have any kind of negative reaction to it. It has a very slight medicinal scent to it which quickly went away after the product was smoothed over my skin. It did not bother me, because I do not like when my face products are saturated with fragrance. A lot of acne products out there dry out my skin, but this one seemed to work well on the days that I tried it. I tried it over the course of about 3 days, because the sample size was very small. I even tried it under some makeup yesterday to see how it would work, and I didn't have any weird pilling or reaction between the product.

Now I have found a serum which is easy to apply and seems quite preventative. I haven't experienced any blemishes trying to breakthrough to the surface. Yes, I'm a devout francophile, but, this does not affect my true opinionated review of Eau Thermale Avene Cleanance Concentrate.  Avene Cleanance Concentrate serum is light to touch. Has a slight emollient feeling without being oily. It's not stripping of the skins natural oils. It stays in place. I advise a drop to use as a treatment, but, if your skin is much more prone to outbreaks and is extremely sensitive: perform a skin test. Somewhere inconspicuous to everyone but you. Wait a day to see if there is some reaction. If not, apply topically to your face. I think you willwill enjoy.",5 out of 5 stars.

5818,Avene Cleanance Comedomed Anti-Blemishes Concentrate 30ml - Acne moisturiser,Maggie H.,"[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I always thought that pimples would be left in my teen years but I was soooo very wrong lol. My skin is very temperamental and I struggle constantly with break outs! I will break out from trying new skin care and make up. I also struggle with hormonal breakouts each month. Not only did this product not make me break out but I also noticed an improvement on my “normal” break outs. Originally when I first received this product I was a little hesitant to just lather all over my face straight away as it has quite a strong chemical like smell. Often products with a strong scent or harsh products can either make me break out badly or get a rash. I decided to do a spot test on the side of my neck for the first night and left until the next morning. Thankfully I had no reaction and continued with the trial. Great packaging, very easy to disburse just the right amount of product. The product spreads really easily. I found that 1 and a half pumps was more than enough. I was using on my neck as I am lucky enough to get pimples there as well! -.-“.I used at night before applying my normal moisturizer, after applying my skin felt clean, not tight or sticky. Overall I noticed an improvement in my skin. My existing pimples healed and I did not notice many new pimples pop up. When they did they weren't as angry and I feel like they healed a little quicker. As I mentioned the only “down side” was the strong smell. However, it dissipates quite quickly once applied to the skin and is not noticeable when you are wearing it. As this product works so well I am more than happy to deal with the scent. I will certainly be purchasing this again!",5 out of 5 stars.

I definitely recommend to anyone else who has acne prone skin like me",5 out of 5 stars.

5822,Avene Cleanance Comedomed Anti-Blemishes Concentrate 30ml - Acne moisturiser,Stephanie P.,"[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I have been using the Avene Cleanance Comedomed morning and night for two weeks now. I found it to be quite a thick texture (which I liked!) and read that a few people used it as a moisturiser, so I replaced my usual moisturiser with this product and only applied sunscreen after. It was enough moisture for me to use as a full-time moisturiser but if you have dry or dehydrated skin, you might need to add another hydration layer on top. I have acne-prone skin and breakouts in all areas of my face and lean towards the oily side. I found this product really helped to calm my skin and reduce texture from previous breakouts. It didn't stop the breakouts completely but I did find that my forehead, where I usually get the majority of breakouts, reduced dramatically. I'll definitely continue using this product to see if it helps breakouts in other areas as nothing has seemed to help so far! It took a bit more than seven days to start seeing results but I can see a difference in two weeks so I hope the improvements continue.",5 out of 5 stars.
5823,Avene Cleanance Comedomed Anti-Blemishes Concentrate 30ml - Acne moisturiser,Marcella D.,"[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] This little legend works almost immediately! I saw a definite reduction in acne and spots. My skin felt smoother as it greatly diminished the amount of texture. Still needed moisturiser after using this product as it is not hydrating enough to be the last thing on my face, but that is not an issue. There is also a slight smell but you'll get used to that quite quickly.The gel-like texture is quite nice and a little bit goes a long way so it lasts and lasts. Honestly, a wonder product! I would definitely recommend this to anyone who is struggling with congestion and I will be purchasing again.",5 out of 5 stars.
5824,Avene Cleanance Comedomed Anti-Blemishes Concentrate 30ml - Acne moisturiser,Katarina K.,"[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I was very sceptical at first when I read that this product claims to significantly reduce blemishes and blackheads from 7 days but to also refines pores appearance from 7 days too. Such big claims too, so I was very excited to get my hands onto it and try it ASAP!On first application it was very light weight, didn’t have a greasy feel and absorbed quickly. I also felt a slight tingle so I knew the formula was getting deep down to attack those blemishes. Once the excess sebum absorbs it leaves a lovely matte finish. Which helped a lot with my oily T - zone. I love that a plant-based active ingredient made from milk thistle oil, works to reduce blemishes and blackheads and limit their reappearance by restoring the balance of the skin. I was using it morning and night within my skin care routine. Within 2 days, I started to see a difference. My red Inflamed blemishes around my chin were at ease and reduced in size. By the end of the week, the blemishes were barely noticeable. I love this product and I’m so glad I was able to trial it as I honestly would of never purchased this in store but now I know that it actually does work. I’ve already purchased a second bottle and It’s staying in my skin care routine.",5 out of 5 stars.

The packaging is simple with an easy to use pump, the formula is a gel which spreads easily- it does have quite a strong scent at first, but like it says on the box, the scent soon disappears completely. It soaks into the skin nicely without drying it out, I haven’t had new breakouts since I have started using the product. I can’t wait to see the continued improvement of my skin.",5 out of 5 stars.

5831,Avene Cleanance Comedomed Anti-Blemishes Concentrate 30ml - Acne moisturiser,Kelli N.,"[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I used this as a serum after using my cleanser and before moisturiser. This product is marketed as &quot;anti-blemish&quot; acne fighter. It is a thick gel which comes out of a really nice pump bottle, which keeps the contents away from air.The gel at first has a really strong alcohol scent, but once applied on the skin, it disappears quickly. It says on the packaging that this is something to be aware of. Luckily for me, I didn't feel the product caused any irritation or made my skin go red, which is a massive plus, given it has such a strong alcohol smell, which is normally an ingredient I try to avoid.Avene claims this product contains an innovative ingredient called Comedoclastin, which doesn't go into details of what ingredients makes up this technology. In any case, I am giving it 5 stars as my acne-prone skin did not react and also did not develop any new pimples which is a big plus for me.The only downside is that because this is a thick gel, it makes it hard to layer products on afterwards, such as moisturiser and sunscreen. I had to &quot;tap&quot; my moisturiser on afterwards (although this product might actually be sufficient for those with really oily skin). Unfortunately when I tried to apply my zinc sunscreen over this, it causes the product to pill.I am impressed with this product and will continue to use this.",5 out of 5 stars.

Even the inflammation on me began to decrease rapidly, the cream did not like me, but it worked.

There is a strong scent but it does go away once it's dried. There's no tackiness/stickiness and my moisturizer doesn't pill when applying it on top of this serum, which is great. I have minor breakouts and so far, I find this serum effective in reducing the redness and puffiness of my blemishes. My forehead is also not as oily as it was before trying this out.

6312,Avene Cleanance Comedomed Anti-Blemishes Concentrate 30ml - Acne moisturiser,Rayla,"I feel like I had a good experience with this product- I received a small sample pack which lasted a surprisingly long time. The instructions say to use twice a day and that results start to appear after a week. I did not use consistently- I sometimes skipped a few days and so the packet lasted close to two weeks. But I still received results- I have very oily, hormonal skin and generally have a lot of acne. My acne seemed to lessen while using this, and my complexion also seemed clearer and more dewy. I’m not completely sure if it was this product, but my acne has worsened since I quite using it. I believe I will buy the full bottle and see what further use does.",4 out of 5 stars.

I put this on after washing my face clean with an oil cleanser. It has a pleasant, light odor, and it didn’t burn, so that’s a plus! I don’t really have blemishes, and only used it for a few days. The main thing I noticed was that my skin still felt smooth, but it felt somewhat dried out. Not like I hadn’t put anything on, but I wondered if I was supposed to follow-up with a moisturizer afterward. Anyway, this is a great brand, so if you have blemishes to correct, this would probably work really well.",4 out of 5 stars.

I received a sample of it and wished I had more product to try it out and give a more full on review, but the amount I was able to try it did help out a bit with my acne and it did not flare it up!

Sometimes my skin is sensitive and has the tendency to burn a bit when putting on serums or acne treatments but this didn't do that.

It wasn’t quit like a lotion but also not oily like some serums can be it’s a mixture of the two. It felt super smooth going on didn’t absorb too fast but wasn’t caked on feeling either it was very smooth silky texture.

6996,Avene Cleanance Comedomed Anti-Blemishes Concentrate 30ml - Acne moisturiser,Kaz2020,"This product has a clear gel like consistency and at first as you apply it the first time it had quite a strong smell, that might be associated with alcohol. However, this smell quickly goes away, and you don't notice it anymore within seconds, and it was good to read that the smell is due to a particular ingredient used. I applied it daily for a couple of weeks on areas on my forehead and temples were I had some small pimples and they seemed to dry up very quickly. The good thing was that sometimes more pimples appear in these areas, and while I've been using this product, I didn't seem to get additional pimples. Have to say it would be more pleasant to use if it had a less potent smell, or a nicer smell to disguise the current one.",4 out of 5 stars.

I have noticed a significant  reduction in how many blemishes and blackheads I've been getting. My skin feels quite hydrated after apply this moisturizer. The texture of the moisturizer is smoothe when you put it on your skin and dries quite quickly. I would highly recommend this product for people that have oily/blemish proned skin. The only thing I disliked about the moisturizer is the chemical smell. If the smell could be changed and impressed, I would make this rating a 5 out of 5.",4 out of 5 stars.
7015,Avene Cleanance Comedomed Anti-Blemishes Concentrate 30ml - Acne moisturiser,Jing F.,"[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] This product comes in a simple pump packaging that makes it easy (and hygienic!) to use. It has the consistency of a gel and sinks into the skin quite quickly. I only needed to use a small amount on my cheeks/jawline so this will last quite a while. While it did reduce the appearance of acne, and has prevented any further outbreaks, I will note that it has a very strong and rather unpleasant chemical smell. It even notes this on the packaging - &quot;The product's odor is related to its innovative ingredient and will quickly disappear&quot;. While it did eventually disappear I did find it a bit overpowering at first. I also noticed it had a bit of a drying effect on my skin, though this was helped by using some moisturiser after application.

7020,Avene Cleanance Comedomed Anti-Blemishes Concentrate 30ml - Acne moisturiser,PandaJ,I've always kept a simple routine with my skin. A scrub three times a week and a mask once a week as well as daily cleanse and moisturize. I replaced my cleanser with Avene cleansing gel. I found the smell to be quite pleasant. It wasn't overbearing or harsh. It left my skin still feeling soft and fresh. I would then follow up with Avene cleanance comedomed. At first I wasn't too keen on it. The smell was like putting an antiseptic on my face but the smell quickly disapeared. I found the cleanance was good for a day or two after using a mask when a pimple or two would appear. It was very quick to clear it up. All in all I'm very happy with the outcome and I recommend it.,4 out of 5 stars.

I deffinitly noted a mattifying finish, and I had limited breakouts during these 2 weeks but I haven't noticed any difference in regards to blackheads/pores.

I was only able to try it once and it didn't seem like it made a big difference. I wanted to see a difference so maybe that's why I thought a couple minutes after I put on the product I thought I seen a difference but my friends said there was no difference.

I was really hoping the Cleanance Concentrate Blemish Control Serum would be the ticket to clear skin, but I honestly couldn't tell you if there was a difference as the sample I received was not large enough to make a difference. Acne products (particularly serums) can take months to achieve a noticeable effect and a single use will not make any difference other than to see how the product smells, looks, feels, etc. The product smells heavily of alcohol and I was worried that it would dry my skin but so far I have not see too much drying. It is a thicker consistency than a lot of serums and was easy to apply and did not leave my skin feeling greasy.

7373,Avene Cleanance Comedomed Anti-Blemishes Concentrate 30ml - Acne moisturiser,lainy,I tried a sample of this from dabble but the sample was too small too really evaluate fully.

7376,Avene Cleanance Comedomed Anti-Blemishes Concentrate 30ml - Acne moisturiser,Amy,"Using a sample is obviously not enough to know whether this product would help my skin/acne, but I don't have a great feeling about it based on the ingredients. The main ingredients are water and isopropyl alcohol, and generally putting isopropyl alcohol all over your face is not good for your skin (especially with an already compromised moisture barrier). I moisturized right after applying the serum and did not have any negative reaction. So while I don't have an actively negative opinion about it, it's hard for me to imagine buying it.",3 out of 5 stars.

7382,Avene Cleanance Comedomed Anti-Blemishes Concentrate 30ml - Acne moisturiser,Peachie,"From what I can tell by the two day supply of the serum, is that it went on like a moisturizer at first but then feels a little tacky on the skin. But when it dries, your face feels smooth, not tacky. It has a hint scent of rubbing alcohol when you first put it on but it goes away quickly. As far as the blemishes, it usually takes at least a few days for you to be able to see any results, and with a small two day sample, it's not going to do what you're wanting it to do.",3 out of 5 stars.

The only thing i can say is that it has a nice consistency and absorbs right into your skin with a slight hint of alcohol smell....

Overall, it seems to do a pretty good job keeping my blemishes in check, however, looking at the ingredients it is little more than water, alcohol, and soap. You could definitely tell it had a lot of alcohol in it---it burns a little after application. Because of the alcohol, I definitely reccomend following up with a good moisturizer. I gave it three stars because it seems effective in doing what it is designed to do, but I wasn't impressed with the ingredients---not only are the ingredients mostly things I already have in my medicine cabinet, I also suspect the alcohol wouldnt be good for your skin with long term use",3 out of 5 stars.

It is a nice consistency--slightly creamier feeling (still gel like) than many other facial serums i have used. even using very little, it seems to sit on the skin, not soak in fully, but not stiff or sticky at all. it does not smell very nice--the initial alcohol smell dissipates instantly, but there is a soft, lingering, muted fruity smell i find off-putting.",3 out of 5 stars.

I have oily, congested skin, but it has been a but dehydrated as the cooler weather sets in in Central Victoria, and I've found my cheeks and forehead have been dryer than they had been than when using my previous product. I did also break out and get two whiteheads, which whilst already uncommon for me, were in areas of my face where I don't even get blackheads so I don't think this was just my skin purging with the introduction of a new product.The product itself has an odd scent, but which dissipates soon after application and isn't a major concern. I like that the product comes in a pump bottle, with one pump the perfect amount for my face.As above, I have liked Avène products in the past and do trust the brand, so I will use the remainder of the product, but likely alternating with my usual serums and moisturisers.",2 out of 5 stars.

One week after I stopped using the serum my face started to return to its prior state so safe to assume that the serum was the cause. Hope it works for others.",1 out of 5 stars.

I’m a big fan of Avene’s thermal water spray (I keep a small one at my desk and one in my bag!) and curious about this sunscreen as it’s not the cheapest on the market but now I’m sold on it. It’s quite milky and thin so you don’t need much to cover. I found I needed to let it sink in for a minute or two before applying any makeup but that’s not a problem. I like that if has no fragrance, which is a big bonus, and a good size to fit in a bag (not too heavy)  It’s a good product and worth the purchase price.",5 out of 5 stars.

The bright orange packaging is cheerful and perfect for summer and it's small enough for your bag so you can take it to the beach and re-apply easily. A little goes a long way so it should last a while which I think justifies the price. I have always loved using their Thermal Spring water spray over summer and this is a welcome addition.",5 out of 5 stars.

7797,Avene Sunscreen Aqua-fluid SPF50+ 40ml - For Sensitive Skin,Alko1,"My first thought when I opened the packaging was the cuteness of the small stylish sunscreen bottle design. If you love miniatures, it would be perfect to fit into a small handbag and impress your friends. The sunscreen has a very high 50+ protection but unlike other high SPFs, it is so easy to apply with its liquid texture and feels very lightweight on the face. It has a slight sheen after application but surprisingly doesn’t feel oily. I use it before I apply my make up but when used alone, it gives off a dewy-like finish. Once summer comes around, it will be a perfect addition to the little beach bag.",5 out of 5 stars.

7801,Avene Sunscreen Aqua-fluid SPF50+ 40ml - For Sensitive Skin,Georgia Papas,Okay so I usually hate wearing sunscreen on my face because it feels too heavy and usually causes my reactive skin to become irritated or break out.

I also really like that the product doesn’t have an intense scent.  The bottle is cute and easy to use. Because it’s a fluid, it’s bit runny, but I don’t see that as a big problem, if it had a thicker consistency I guess it would not absorb the quickly as it does.",5 out of 5 stars.
7804,Avene Sunscreen Aqua-fluid SPF50+ 40ml - For Sensitive Skin,Eila,"This is my new favourite facial sunscreen! There's nothing worse than spending 5 minutes trying to rub thick, white sunscreen into my face. This product completely avoids that problem. The consistency is super thin and runny which means it blends in quickly and easily. I also love that it's SPF50+ as I'm very pale and freckle prone, and living in Australia I need to ensure my skin is protected from the harsh sun on a daily basis. The packaging is compact and easy to travel with. It also doesn't give me an allergic reaction as other sunscreens have in the past. It's a winner!",5 out of 5 stars.
7805,Avene Sunscreen Aqua-fluid SPF50+ 40ml - For Sensitive Skin,Katy_potaty,"This fluid spreads really easily to form a uniform protective layer, does not remain sticky or greasy and gives a very light smell, the texture is intermediate between a cream and a gel, very simple to apply.

7813,Avene Sunscreen Aqua-fluid SPF50+ 40ml - For Sensitive Skin,Amy St,"I've previously used the Avene Emulsion SPF50 and loved it, so I had high hopes for their new fluid sunscreen. And it did not disappoint! It's such a lovely sunscreen to apply. It has a really runny consistency that's easy to apply and rub in. It's light on your skin, but still gives some hydration and feels comfortable once it's rubbed in and dried down. It gives an almost silky finish that works like a primer for your make up. I love that this sits well under make up and doesn't pill or disrupt make up like other sunscreens can. The packaging is cute and fits neatly into your bag or even your pocket. You need to shake it first before using it. I find this has worked well on my sensitive and rosacea skin, as it hasn't irritated my skin at all.

It is such a thin consistency and absorbs into the skin really well, without feeling greasy. There's a bit of an almost chalky residue, but that might be because I apply it heavy handedly. It doesn't have a smell at all, the nozzle is a clever round design so it's hard to leave a mess and easy to get out.  I wish they gave specific instructions on how much to use - I've been told that you need more sunscreen than you think you would to get good protection, and theres no real indication on how much is the right amount.",5 out of 5 stars.

I love the cute travel-size packaging which you can easily put in your bag to re-apply throughout the day.  There is no sign of fragrance which is the most preferred for sensitive skin people like me!  I enjoyed using this product under makeup and it doesn't disrupt my makeup, instead acts really well as a makeup primer.  I do leave the sunscreen sinks into my skin for a few minutes before applying my complexion base as the sunscreen is still flexible.   I highly recommend this product to anyone or for the family who is looking for a new sunscreen to try out this Summer!",5 out of 5 stars.

This sunscreen is a thin texture which makes it super easy to apply and spread over my face.There was a slight white cast that probably made my face a shade lighter than my skin tone, however within 5-10minutes it settles and the white cast is gone.My skin absorbs the sunscreen so well and easily, theres no skin irritation and leaves my skin non-sticky or oily which i dislike in a lot of sunscreens.I have very little bad comments to say about this sunscreen as it ticks all my boxes, my only negative points is possibly the very slight fragrance and the white cast however i dont think either of those are much negative points.but also to say i have non sensitive skin but definitely found my favourite sunscreen for my face and not a bad price point too!",5 out of 5 stars.

7902,Avene Sunscreen Aqua-fluid SPF50+ 40ml - For Sensitive Skin,conniepapa,I really liked this sunscreen for the face because it has a very thin and runny texture which doesn’t cake on and glides across your skin easily. It absorbs really well and doesn’t leave a residue. That’s the issue I usually have with sunscreens. It’s also high protection as it’s 50+ but I haven’t put this to the test yet as it hasn’t been so sunny where I am. Only down side is that I usually like my day cream to have a combined sunscreen but this is good if you’re out in the sun all day and need to reapply.

It has the watery texture of an Asian sunscreen, but the price point and availability makes this an easier option. With absolutely no scent, and a gentle hydrating texture it is a pleasure to apply. I tip it into my palm to make sure I’m using enough and apply with a brush. It leaves a slight white cast so I can see if I missed any areas and then rubs in without much effort. It hasn’t stung my face or eyes, doesn’t pill under makeup, is in a convenient container and hasn’t caused clogging or dryness. Will repurchase.",5 out of 5 stars.

7910,Avene Sunscreen Aqua-fluid SPF50+ 40ml - For Sensitive Skin,PT2021,"I’ve been using this product for about 2 weeks everyday. It’s perfect under makeup as it’s so light and absorbs into the skin very quickly. Only very little is needed, I put way too much the first time. Great product with a high SPF protection.",5 out of 5 stars.
7911,Avene Sunscreen Aqua-fluid SPF50+ 40ml - For Sensitive Skin,LG1985,"I have been using this sunscreen on my kids sensitive skin and we all really love it - no sunscreeny smell or greasiness, and hasn't irritated their skin. We are very happy with this product and I would definitely recommend it!",5 out of 5 stars.
7912,Avene Sunscreen Aqua-fluid SPF50+ 40ml - For Sensitive Skin,hannahhatstand,"This works like a charm as a final step in your skincare routine. Provides great protection and makes an even better base for make up application which is a bonus. It does have a slightly white residue on the skin but only if you use more than necessary, only a small amount is required to cover your face. Definitely recommend if you're looking for an easy to use and great protection SPF.",5 out of 5 stars.
7913,Avene Sunscreen Aqua-fluid SPF50+ 40ml - For Sensitive Skin,KaylaP,"My skin is normally super sensitive to SPF, But since using the Avenue aqua fluid sunscreen I haven't had any reaction. This sunscreen feels great on the skin, it is super lightweight and wears well under makeup. It also hasn't broke my skin out which is a major plus! Just be careful when squeezing the product out of the bottle as it is a very thin consistancy. You also don't need to use a lot as it spreads across the skin really easily and doesn't feel greasy. Definitely will be repurchasing this sunscreen- My new favourite!",5 out of 5 stars.
7914,Avene Sunscreen Aqua-fluid SPF50+ 40ml - For Sensitive Skin,Cassbianx,"Love this brand, great quality French brand and does not irritate my skin.  I use this on my face and hands and it's a great size for handbag and reapplication during the day.  Nice and light, sinks in easily.",5 out of 5 stars.
7915,Avene Sunscreen Aqua-fluid SPF50+ 40ml - For Sensitive Skin,RachaelMaree,"Wow Wow Wow.First of all when the bottle reads for sensitive skin, unltra lightweight and invisible finish - THEY WEREN'T WRONG! My skin is highly sensitive especially my face. And naughty me usually avoids sunscreen on my face because it makes me break out. NOT THIS ONE! I'm obsessed. And even tested under my makeup! This really is a game changer! I love that you don't feel sticky, greasy or PASTEY WHITE when you put it on. Been at the beach last couple of days and safe to say this is an epic product. Looking forward to summer with my new fave sunscreen! Thanks Avène!!",5 out of 5 stars.
7916,Avene Sunscreen Aqua-fluid SPF50+ 40ml - For Sensitive Skin,mizkrissi,"Have tried a lot of sunscreens over the years looking for one that was actually weightless, non-chalky and did not irritate my skin and almost always have been disappointed in them. They would end up too drying, too greasy, too chalky, irritating or would pill under makeup or make it slide off. I had basically given up finding a good day to day facial sunscreen until I tried Avene's Aqua Fluid Face. I have sensitive, easily dehydrated combination skin with a T zone that can go from settled to ""fry chips"" in an hour with the wrong products. I found this product moisturising enough to use over the top of toner/serum alone, instead of on top of my moisturiser, and I would recommend if you tend to slick easily in humid, hot conditions that you see which works better for you. I hate the feeling of any product on my face and tend to be a face toucher so I notice immediately if my face is getting shiny. This gives a lovely satin finish to the skin that is comfortable on low humidity days. Easily removed with micellar water or an oil cleanse as a first step. I wear contacts and did not experience any eye irritation or issues and I had patted the sunscreen across my whole face including the eye and lip areas. Under a light dusting of mineral powder I felt great for a full day with no weird oxidising side effects. Definitely recommend giving this a try if you have been searching for a suitable facial sunscreen without any luck previously",5 out of 5 stars.
7917,Avene Sunscreen Aqua-fluid SPF50+ 40ml - For Sensitive Skin,akalalouie,"It looks like a tiny bottle but a little goes a long way - great for traveling / on the go. This fluid offers high protection and worked a charm in really sunny weather. It is fragrance-free and great for sensitive skin. I prefer a very matte SPF finish, and it would have been five stars but it is still a little shiny for my liking.",5 out of 5 stars.
7918,Avene Sunscreen Aqua-fluid SPF50+ 40ml - For Sensitive Skin,omyara,"I've been using this sunscreen for about a week and I'm enjoying it quite a lot. It's very lightweight, absorbs quickly into the skin, has no fragrance, is easy to blend, and is not greasy. It has a slight white cast to it, but it did not bother me. It sits well under makeup, it does not sting my eyes, the packaging is very sleek and purse-friendly. All in all, I'm very impressed and would repurchase again.I can see this easily going to be my go-to summer sunscreen.",5 out of 5 stars.
7919,Avene Sunscreen Aqua-fluid SPF50+ 40ml - For Sensitive Skin,disco_queen99,"When it comes to sunscreen I'm very particular about what I use, as I have sensitive skin and tend to break out from rich, thick sunscreens. For over the past 7 days, Avene Aqua Fluid Sunscreen has been part of my religious morning routine. This product delivers everything it claims and literally is liquid gold for your skin. Just be mindful when squeezing out the product as it has a thinner consistency compared to other sunscreens, you don't want to waste more than what you need. I was amazed how quickly it absorbed into my skin, making me look fresh, hydrated and glowing. I'm a very active person and my skin didn't feel clogged with heavy, thick sunscreen, quite the opposite, so lightweight that it didn't feel like I had anything on my skin and it could breathe through the product. Another bonus is, my skin has not broken out, everything a girl could want!! I highly recommend this product!!",5 out of 5 stars.
7920,Avene Sunscreen Aqua-fluid SPF50+ 40ml - For Sensitive Skin,SLM9,"I've always had trouble finding sunscreen for my face as it would always irritate and aggravate my skin. This has been a game changer for me. No reaction at all, so lightweight, quickly absorbed so it feels like my skin has nothing on it. Perfect for under makeup and i actually use it as my primer too. My makeup sits perfectly on the top of it. The scent is pleasant and barely there to be honest. The packaging is cute too which is always a plus! It's now an essential in my daily routine.",5 out of 5 stars.
7921,Avene Sunscreen Aqua-fluid SPF50+ 40ml - For Sensitive Skin,Gracie961,"I’ve been testing this sunscreen out for about a week now and it smells pleasant and doesn’t leave my skin oily. It’s a great primer for makeup too. Doesn’t leave a white cast. My favourite part about it, is the packaging. It’s perfect for the handbag and is such a cute little bottle. I take it in my purse everywhere with me now pat the product on and reapply during the middle of the day.",5 out of 5 stars.
7922,Avene Sunscreen Aqua-fluid SPF50+ 40ml - For Sensitive Skin,Rochelle 123,This sunscreen is beautiful and lightweight with next toNo scent. At first when I applied it there was a white cast however this quickly fades. Happy with the longevity.,5 out of 5 stars.
7923,Avene Sunscreen Aqua-fluid SPF50+ 40ml - For Sensitive Skin,kelsbellz,I have been using this sunscreen for a while now and I love it! It is really lightweight and makes my skin feel soft and silky without leaving a greasy or white film. I have been using it under my make up. My tip is to wait about 5 minutes after applying it to let it sink into your skin before applying makeup. My skin is quite sensitive so I struggle to find sunscreens that don't block my pores but I have been super impressed with this sunscreen and haven't had any issues with daily use.,5 out of 5 stars.
7924,Avene Sunscreen Aqua-fluid SPF50+ 40ml - For Sensitive Skin,kasandra,This is a very light weight liquid sunscreen it’s easily buildable and it doesn’t feel like anything when applied onto the screen i’ve used it doing sports and sweating and unlike other sunscreens i’ve used i never felt like it was starting to come off while sweating which is a bonus,5 out of 5 stars.
7925,Avene Sunscreen Aqua-fluid SPF50+ 40ml - For Sensitive Skin,Jasmin EC,"Really happy with how this sunscreen is working for me. I often get a reaction to sunscreen, particularly on my face, but I’ve had no issues whatsoever with this one. After many days of use, my skin hasn't broken out in acne or a rash, not have my eyes gone red or weepy. The product is super runny, but is lightweight as it claims to be. I find it leaves a very slight sheen on the skin, which goes away after 30 mins, and no white cast. There is also pretty much no scent, which I also love. Definitely recommend this one.",5 out of 5 stars.
7926,Avene Sunscreen Aqua-fluid SPF50+ 40ml - For Sensitive Skin,Frankiielot,I use this product everyday before I leave the house and absolutely love it!It's lightweight and doesn't leave my skin greasy/oily looking. It also goes on well under my foundation. It has a super light scent and is white in colour but blends into the skin without leaving any white marks. It's SPF50+ which is the perfect amount of coverage for the Australian sun. I definitely recommend this product.,5 out of 5 stars.
7927,Avene Sunscreen Aqua-fluid SPF50+ 40ml - For Sensitive Skin,Ozchicksta,The sunscreen came in a cute little box. It stated innovative and weightless on the box so I was thinking the product must be light. I was really impressed it was SPF 50+. The container the sunscreen came in was very cute also.    It was very easy to off the lid of the container. It was very easy to squeeze the sunscreen out. The sunscreen was a really nice bright white colour. I loved how it was fragrance free. It was so easy to rub into my skin. My skin absorbed it really well. The sunscreen really lives up to being weightless and invisible as this is what the product was like. It had a really thin consistency and was non-greasy.   A great product!,5 out of 5 stars.
7928,Avene Sunscreen Aqua-fluid SPF50+ 40ml - For Sensitive Skin,Esther888,"When i first tried this sunscreen, i was a bit disappointed. It does leave a white cats. Even on me, and i have light skin. However! once i put on make up (tinted cream or BB cream), this is absolutely beautiful! It sits so well under my make-up and i swear it make it last longer! I also don't get any irritation or breakouts from it. Very travel friendly, although the bottle is not too big so you might go through it quite quickly.",4 out of 5 stars.
7929,Avene Sunscreen Aqua-fluid SPF50+ 40ml - For Sensitive Skin,rosehazel93,"This is a great choice as far as affordable high-SPF sunscreens go. It's not the best one I've used, but will absolutely do the job, and is in a handy-sized package to be popped in a handbag or beachbag. I found the texture of the product to be slightly runnier than I was expecting - but that's better than it being too thick! You need to give the product a chance to rest on the face before applying other product, as there is a faint white cast after first applying, and the skin feels slightly tacky to the touch. I did not try putting makeup on top, I just used this alone when headed out to the beach, but it meant I did not add any moisturiser since there was plenty in this.",4 out of 5 stars.
7930,Avene Sunscreen Aqua-fluid SPF50+ 40ml - For Sensitive Skin,Rachie123,"I love the brand for their sensitive skin products (cicalfate is a staple) and this lives up to their usual standard.

7931,Avene Sunscreen Aqua-fluid SPF50+ 40ml - For Sensitive Skin,Mansi Nand,"One the best sunscreens I have tried in years, has such a smooth finish and leaves your skin so glowy, it’s really buildable and great for the warm days.",4 out of 5 stars.
7932,Avene Sunscreen Aqua-fluid SPF50+ 40ml - For Sensitive Skin,Indya,"This sunscreen is really nice and light, it sits fairly well under make up and there’s no white caste to it.

7933,Avene Sunscreen Aqua-fluid SPF50+ 40ml - For Sensitive Skin,melie_628,"This sunscreen is great for a few reasons! It doesn’t have a sunscreen smell, it spreads easily, it isn’t heavy on the skin and definitely light weight. I have sensitive skin and it doesn’t react at all. I don’t really wear makeup so can’t comment on how buildable it is. It comes in a small little bottle so great to pop in my work bag, however the only downside is that if I can’t wash my hands after putting it on, it does leave my fingers a fair bit sticky after applying, doesn’t really leave a sticky feeling in the face though.",4 out of 5 stars.
7934,Avene Sunscreen Aqua-fluid SPF50+ 40ml - For Sensitive Skin,katywlee,Lightweight sunscreen however has a bit of white cast which takes a little bit of time to sink in. I do like the texture though!,4 out of 5 stars.
7935,Avene Sunscreen Aqua-fluid SPF50+ 40ml - For Sensitive Skin,Susie Venkat,"Sunscreen was light; it was very liquidy and a little went a long way. However it developed grease on my face during the day which made me shiny which wasn't what I wanted. But it was good when I was intentionally going out in the sun, because I knew I was being protected. I like the fact that it is SPF50. The small packaging was cute and its still going, cause 'a little goes a long way'. Spent a lot of time in the sun and never got sunburnt.",4 out of 5 stars.
7936,Avene Sunscreen Aqua-fluid SPF50+ 40ml - For Sensitive Skin,Penny S,This product is very light on application and has a lovely sheen finish.

7938,Avene Sunscreen Aqua-fluid SPF50+ 40ml - For Sensitive Skin,Jodsy75,I really liked the Avene Aqua fluid sunscreen. Initially I didn’t like the way the sunscreen went on with a white tinge and sitting quite heavy on top of the skin but after a few minutes it soaked tight in and felt nice and light and non greasy. It’s ideal to wear under make up too. Great sunscreen.,4 out of 5 stars.
7939,Avene Sunscreen Aqua-fluid SPF50+ 40ml - For Sensitive Skin,domils,"I think this is a really great sunscreen for sensitive skin - almost zero fragrance and it melts in your skin.

7940,Avene Sunscreen Aqua-fluid SPF50+ 40ml - For Sensitive Skin,Laura P,"I really like this sunscreen and think its great for everyday use. The texture is really light and absorbs quickly, with no white sheen or greasiness. I have quite sensitive skin and it felt really nice and hydrating, not irritating at all! It works well under makeup, and also lasted well during a few outdoor sweat sessions. It does smell a bit more 'sunscreeny' than some other face sunscreen brands, but its certainly not unpleasant and wouldn't stop me from buying again!",4 out of 5 stars.
7941,Avene Sunscreen Aqua-fluid SPF50+ 40ml - For Sensitive Skin,JazzyT95,"Beautiful option that doesn’t break the budget but does the job without hassle of white casts or burning! Nice for under makeup, but as I’m very dry I need to have moisturiser on aswell.",4 out of 5 stars.

So interesting when it arrived I wasn’t blown away, however after first usage I was sold. I’ve tried many, MANY sunscreens and always pride myself on my snobbery and pure obnoxious level of advocation of SPF on the daily. I’ve never tried an Avene SPF before now, but will be back for more with this one. Super thin, weightless, odourless and undetectable over skincare and under makeup. It doesn’t sting my eyes, and only leaves a white cast for a few moments post application, no interference with other brands, skincare pilling or makeup application. The bottle is lightweight, travel friendly and doesn’t leak! She’s seem less and a total winner! A yes from me, a repurchase for sure!",4 out of 5 stars.
7945,Avene Sunscreen Aqua-fluid SPF50+ 40ml - For Sensitive Skin,Jadeee,"I really enjoy the way this sunscreen feels on my skin, it is very light and not too greasy. It also absorbs really easily.

7946,Avene Sunscreen Aqua-fluid SPF50+ 40ml - For Sensitive Skin,Cmuller,"I’ll start by saying Avène is a brand I would trust in general so as a sunscreen/ sod … yes this product definitely does it’s job. I love the lightweight feel and how easy it absorbs. It’s hard to find that with high spf sunscreens. I’ve been using it before my make up as instructed. It does leave a whitish hue on your face if you use it alone and if you have very oily skin this product probably isn’t for you unfortunately as it does leave a dewy kind of look and feel. For a daily sunscreen for under my make up, I find this a really good product !!",4 out of 5 stars.
7947,Avene Sunscreen Aqua-fluid SPF50+ 40ml - For Sensitive Skin,Maroubra Mum,"This sunscreen is great for when out walking or exercising as it's extremely light weight and non-greasy. I live by the beach and exercise regularly, so it's important my sunscreen protects me from the elements, including the wind, and doesn't leave any sheen. I also found I didn't need to use much for total coverage, so that's a big bonus at this price point.",4 out of 5 stars.
7948,Avene Sunscreen Aqua-fluid SPF50+ 40ml - For Sensitive Skin,LiliRiches,"Not only this sunscreen is light and smooth, it dry fast and comes in a pocket size that fits in any handbags, it feel nice on my skin and easy to apply underneath of makeups, a must for my daily routine.

7954,Avene Sunscreen Aqua-fluid SPF50+ 40ml - For Sensitive Skin,sydneyswans90,"The Avene Aqua Fluid is just as the name suggests, a very light fluid that applies so nicely onto the skin. SPF50+ is fantastic, and is so different in consistency to previous SPF50 sunscreens which were thick. I also love that it is fragrance free, offers very high protection, and is quickly absorbed into the skin. However, I have oily skin and it leaves my skin looking glowy and a bit shiny. For those with drier skin, it would probably look really nice and dewy. I also did find that it feels a tad greasy as the day wears on, but some powder fixes that.The bottle is such a cute, portable size, and the packaging is really distinctive, so it’s easy to spot in your bathroom. My only complaint is that it can get a bit messy, as the sunscreen comes out quick and fast – I think a thin tip would suit this consistency better.Other than that, for such a high protection sunscreen, this is incredibly easy to wear daily, and as it comes in a small size, would be great to pop into my bag for reapplication throughout the day.",4 out of 5 stars.

It's lightweight, easy to apply after my skincare routine and absorbed quickly. No white piling when applied on top of my daily facial serum, and the same with my makeup on top. However, I find it leaves my face slightly glossy (or maybe not entirely dry/matte finish) but it doesn't bother me too much. The SPF 50+ is a huge bonus, and it comes in a small pocket size that I could bring along with me every day. So no more excuse not to reapply throughout the day! Would recommend!",4 out of 5 stars.

7974,Avene Sunscreen Aqua-fluid SPF50+ 40ml - For Sensitive Skin,SharonS17,I don’t normally wear sunscreen because I don’t like the thick sticky texture that comes with most sunscreens. Even “lightweight” sunscreens end up being too thick for my liking so I was totally BLOWN AWAY at how incredibly thin and light this sunscreen is! The milky texture makes it glide onto the skin perfectly! The sunscreen layer is so light that I can easily apply makeup over the top without feeling like my makeup is melting into my sunscreen. I took off a star because of the smell though. It’s not the worst but I have smelt some nicer ones!,4 out of 5 stars.
7975,Avene Sunscreen Aqua-fluid SPF50+ 40ml - For Sensitive Skin,Mamajojo,"I have been using the Avene sunscreen aqua fluid for a couple of weeks now and I am really happy with it. It is lightweight and very easy to spread. It’s not thick and suffocating like many other sunscreens I have tried. It has also been perfect for my sensitive, often reactive skin and I have had no issues at all.  It also goes perfectly under make up. I would definitely buy this product again and recommend it to my friends.",4 out of 5 stars.
7976,Avene Sunscreen Aqua-fluid SPF50+ 40ml - For Sensitive Skin,amy_lizz84,"I didn't really know what to expect from this product and that continued when I squeezed some out onto my hand. I think we're so used to sunscreen being thick but this is so light. A little goes a long way and its super hydrating without creating that oily shine that other sunscreens can create. I love that its 50+ and the bottle size is great for the beach bag, handbag or gymbag. Also looks fabulous under makeup. Highly recommended!!!",4 out of 5 stars.
7977,Avene Sunscreen Aqua-fluid SPF50+ 40ml - For Sensitive Skin,amitchell,"This sunscreen is really lightweight which is great when applying to your face, it feels like you are wearing nothing at all. There is no scent which is a added bonus (I am not a big fan of smelling sunscreen all day long). I am a person who wears makeup everyday, the sunscreen went on nicely underneath my makeup however my makeup did come of easier throughout the day. The next day I put the sunscreen on and waited around 15 minutes for it to dry into my skin before applying my makeup, this worked a whole lot better. Overall a great sunscreen and the bottle size is convenient to keep in your handbag.",4 out of 5 stars.
7978,Avene Sunscreen Aqua-fluid SPF50+ 40ml - For Sensitive Skin,Courtney_90,"I was expecting great things from this product as I regularly use other Avene skincare products in my day to day skin routine. From someone who has very oily skin, the Avene suncream was so lightweight, spreads easily and absorbs well into the skin - leaving no white cast. It sat nicely under my makeup each day, without feeling heavy.",4 out of 5 stars.
7979,Avene Sunscreen Aqua-fluid SPF50+ 40ml - For Sensitive Skin,NikkiSh,"I have been using this sunscreen for a few weeks now and it’s easily become a staple in my routine. It is lightweight, hydrating and gives a slight sheen to the skin. I have very dry sensitive skin and I didn’t react to this one at all. It works quite well under makeup. My only issue is that it goes a bit white on my brown skin. In conclusion this sunscreen works quite well, doesn’t feel too sticky and doesn’t pill on the skin. Very affordable too!",4 out of 5 stars.
7980,Avene Sunscreen Aqua-fluid SPF50+ 40ml - For Sensitive Skin,kaixis,"This is an incredibly light, watery sunscreen that would be great for Summer as it's non sticky and sinks in relatively quick. I am quite pale however I don't think this will leave too much, if any, white cast. My only gripe is if your skin is dry, the white pigments will cling onto your dry patches. It doesn't smell the best, slightly sour, but I still haven't tried a sunscreen that smells nice and the smell does dissipate after it's on your face.",4 out of 5 stars.
7981,Avene Sunscreen Aqua-fluid SPF50+ 40ml - For Sensitive Skin,Koco,I love the texture of this sunscreen. It’s like a serum and easily absorbed into the skin. It’s really lightweight and perfect under makeup.,4 out of 5 stars.
7982,Avene Sunscreen Aqua-fluid SPF50+ 40ml - For Sensitive Skin,SamanthaS,"The Avène Sunscreen Aqua Fluid SPF50+ does everything it claims! I have extremely dry acne prone skin, and its lightweight formula is essential to get the protection, whilst also not irritating my skin. I would recommend having in your handbag, as its a great travel size.",4 out of 5 stars.
7983,Avene Sunscreen Aqua-fluid SPF50+ 40ml - For Sensitive Skin,ChantelM,"I really like the size and packaging it is easy to take out and about. I found it has a very light scent which I didn’t enjoy but it wasn’t unbearable. I really like that it has a luminous effect on the skin and feels really light weight, it also blends into the skin almost immediately.",4 out of 5 stars.
7984,Avene Sunscreen Aqua-fluid SPF50+ 40ml - For Sensitive Skin,Paulinied,Been using over the past weeks and love the thin texture which absorbs into the skin and is great under makeup. Unfortunately it is very runny and could be a better consistency for application.,4 out of 5 stars.
7985,Avene Sunscreen Aqua-fluid SPF50+ 40ml - For Sensitive Skin,danizim23,I have tried it and it’s great size bottle and it feels nice on the skin but it’s too runny and comes out too quickly so I prefer cream.,4 out of 5 stars.
7986,Avene Sunscreen Aqua-fluid SPF50+ 40ml - For Sensitive Skin,helenrey,"I am usually quite cautious about sunscreen but  really liked this.  I would say I have somewhat  sensitive skin and have found I get a little eczma round the edges of my nose when using many sunscreens.  Have been trying this for a while now and it seems not to have that effect.  Goes on smoothly, not greasy, works under make up. I am happy to keep using and would recommend you give it a shot.",4 out of 5 stars.
7987,Avene Sunscreen Aqua-fluid SPF50+ 40ml - For Sensitive Skin,LisaMS,"I love this sunscreen, fragrant free and it's super lightweight, it absorbs pretty much straight away into your skin, so it's great for wearing everyday under your makeup.",4 out of 5 stars.
7988,Avene Sunscreen Aqua-fluid SPF50+ 40ml - For Sensitive Skin,Ls2323,"A great little bottle for the face. The sunscreen is light weight, non greasy and not oily. It sits well on top of skincare and well under makeup. This would work for people with oilier skin too as it's not too shiney. I didn't experience a white caste.",4 out of 5 stars.
7989,Avene Sunscreen Aqua-fluid SPF50+ 40ml - For Sensitive Skin,Refnugz,"Good format for facial sun protection and moisturizer. Easy to apply, non-sticky and feels lightweight on skin.",4 out of 5 stars.
7990,Avene Sunscreen Aqua-fluid SPF50+ 40ml - For Sensitive Skin,Amy Lee1,Love the fluid light texture of this sunscreen,4 out of 5 stars.
7991,Avene Sunscreen Aqua-fluid SPF50+ 40ml - For Sensitive Skin,Heather777,"Light-weight as described. Doesn’t irritate my sensitive skin. Easy to apply foundation after it. I like that it has no fragrance, won’t make your face all very white.",4 out of 5 stars.
7992,Avene Sunscreen Aqua-fluid SPF50+ 40ml - For Sensitive Skin,CVKK,"Avene wasn’t kidding when they said it was ultra-lightweight. It does have the appearance of it being watered down & it’s very runny but a little goes very far, you only need a small amount. It is fragrance free but smells unpleasant once you’ve rubbed it in and it smelt even worse once I applied it after a couple of hrs at the beach. On the plus side I came home with no sunburn so this sunscreen does the job.",4 out of 5 stars.
7993,Avene Sunscreen Aqua-fluid SPF50+ 40ml - For Sensitive Skin,Irish Phoenix,great little pack easy to bring with me everywhere and pop on when needed.  Non greasy which is such a big bonus with sunscreen. Love it.,4 out of 5 stars.
7994,Avene Sunscreen Aqua-fluid SPF50+ 40ml - For Sensitive Skin,shinyglitterbug,"This white hued aqua fluid sunscreen from Avene is super runny and lightweight in texture. It is easy to apply and absorbs into the skin quickly. It leaves my skin feeling soft and supple and I love that it offers 50 SPF. The packaging design is cute and functional, and the bottle is little enough to pop in my handbag to re-apply throughout the day. This is a great quality sunscreen that I'd definitely recommend!",4 out of 5 stars.
7995,Avene Sunscreen Aqua-fluid SPF50+ 40ml - For Sensitive Skin,Faffles,"This product is exactly as advertised - high protection with SPF 50, ultra lightweight and invisible. It's such a thin consistency that it goes on great before makeup and absorbs into the skin with zero stickiness. The only issue for me is the smell. I do like my products to smell nice, and I found the smell something to tolerate, not like. That's the product though - it's fragrance free to appeal to those with sensitivities. Overall functionality 5 stars, just one star off for the fragrance not to my liking. Others may not mind it!",4 out of 5 stars.
7996,Avene Sunscreen Aqua-fluid SPF50+ 40ml - For Sensitive Skin,AngelaScordo,"The first thing I noticed about this sunscreen is that it is very lightweight and absorbs into my skin quickly. It does not leave a sticky, white film on my skin throughout the day. I find because it is so lightweight it's great for under my daily makeup.",4 out of 5 stars.
7997,Avene Sunscreen Aqua-fluid SPF50+ 40ml - For Sensitive Skin,Carleewilko1,Cute bright easy to pop into your handbag packaging that’s very practical too. I enjoyed that it was suitable for sensitive skin and was very high protection sunscreen. It didn’t break me out at all as some sunscreens have in past. The product is thin and goes on white but blends effortlessly transparent/ invisible when rubbed in. It’s not sticky and sat well under my make up for the day. The only negatives were even though it’s fragrance free it has light smell to it that I can’t quite explain and that it is hard to reapply over makeup if needed due to the white colouring of liquid (I tried to reapply it with a sponge over makeup after 2 hours). If you don’t wear make up then this isn’t an issue.,4 out of 5 stars.
7998,Avene Sunscreen Aqua-fluid SPF50+ 40ml - For Sensitive Skin,Carlota,"I like the effect of the product on my skin. I used it before applying the makeup, the absorption was quick and left the skin without shine. I use sunscreen every day on my face and I will continue to use Avène Sunscreen aqua-fluid.",4 out of 5 stars.
7999,Avene Sunscreen Aqua-fluid SPF50+ 40ml - For Sensitive Skin,Lis1208,"First time user of this sunscreen and loved how lightweight it was! It is the perfect size to throw in a handbag, sports bag or glove box. We loved that it left your skin feeling fresh and didn't have an oily or sticky feeling to it. No fragrance was great because additives often leave a rash on my sensitive face. and I had no reaction with this sunscreen. Unfortunately it is a little pricey compared to some other brands.",4 out of 5 stars.
8000,Avene Sunscreen Aqua-fluid SPF50+ 40ml - For Sensitive Skin,Ourlens,"This was an absolute dream to apply, light weight and easy to rub over my face and neck area. Unfortunately it did leave me with a white cast and greasy texture on my skin so i would probably not use this under make up. I like that it is spf50 and the bottle is super handy for my handbag or travelling.",4 out of 5 stars.
8001,Avene Sunscreen Aqua-fluid SPF50+ 40ml - For Sensitive Skin,Hayking,"I’m a big fan of Avene products so I was very excited to try their sunscreen! Living up to the description, this is definitely a lightweight formula and feels almost like a serum which I absolutely love. It’s not greasy and absorbs nicely into the skin. I will say though it does apply onto the skin with a white film and it does take a bit of work to completely neutralise it. Aside from that, it’s a really comfortable wear, doesn’t have the usual sunscreen scent and is nice and thin when applied.",4 out of 5 stars.
8002,Avene Sunscreen Aqua-fluid SPF50+ 40ml - For Sensitive Skin,AceMoon10,Thought I'd give this a go but not as good as La Roche Posay Invisible Fluid. This by comparison I found didn't go in as quickly and left a white cast on me.,3 out of 5 stars.
8003,Avene Sunscreen Aqua-fluid SPF50+ 40ml - For Sensitive Skin,eks02,"This spf is soo nice and lightweight! Perfect texture for summer on my oily skin, also love that it's fragrance free as my skin is quite sensitive. Unfortunately it does leave a white cast on my south east Asian tan skin. Makeup hides it well but I don't wear makeup everyday so sadly I can't use this very often.",3 out of 5 stars.
8004,Avene Sunscreen Aqua-fluid SPF50+ 40ml - For Sensitive Skin,Paris M,"It is ultra lightweight, fragrance free and non greasy with fluidly texture. The product was a bit runny and fluid, I personally prefer lightweight product but with little more creamier texture. But if you are looking for a ultralight product, I highly recommend to give it a try.",3 out of 5 stars.
8005,Avene Sunscreen Aqua-fluid SPF50+ 40ml - For Sensitive Skin,Niktasi20,The packaging on this little bottle is super cute! It’s super handy for travel or to slip into the beach bag for a top up when in the sun for the day. There is no real fragrance but their is a slight scent that isn’t all that pleasing. I love the coconut scented ones personally so it would have been great to have something like that in it where they could use coconut oils etc. The sunscreen wasn’t too oily and was eased rubbed in and soaked into my skin. There was no tingles or anything that came from this product and felt light and non irritant on my face.,3 out of 5 stars.
8006,Avene Sunscreen Aqua-fluid SPF50+ 40ml - For Sensitive Skin,Mazz1,"I have been using this sunscreen for a while and find it's a nice sunscreen with a fantastic level of protection.  I did find it did leave a greasy residue that wasn't great for under makeup but otherwise it was a good sunscreen.  I am light skinned and the white cast was a little hard to rub in and I think med-deep skinned beauties might have issue with this. All in all a high protection sunscreen that does its job well so I would recommend to others. Great packaging too, just to add, small and easy to pop in a bag to take for when you're on the go !",3 out of 5 stars.
8007,Avene Sunscreen Aqua-fluid SPF50+ 40ml - For Sensitive Skin,Jesserin,Not the greatest sunscreen I have used; was a bit too greasy for my skin and if you are prone to breakouts from sunscreen I would not recommend. Does not absorb as well as some others on the market. It is scentless and does not make my skin feel dry after use.,3 out of 5 stars.
8008,Avene Sunscreen Aqua-fluid SPF50+ 40ml - For Sensitive Skin,LeahP,"Full disclosure - this product is awesome, but I would really love it more if it didn't have a white cast to it! This sunscreen comes in a small bottle that makes it very easy for you to pop into your bag. I love that this affords a high degree of protection while staying non-greasy, and lightweight. The consistency of this is thin, fluid, and spreads easily on the skin, allowing you to smooth this all over the face without any difficulty. However, I find that this doesn't blend out completely on Asian skintones, and as such, I cannot give it more than 3 stars. I do love that this doesn't interact with my makeup, and that it is unscented, however, and otherwise, this is a brilliant sunscreen.",3 out of 5 stars.
8009,Avene Sunscreen Aqua-fluid SPF50+ 40ml - For Sensitive Skin,Anonymous,I have tried a lot of sunscreens. This one isn’t my favourite. I don’t think it would be suitable for people with darker skin because it has a white cast and need to blend in for too long so not good for on the go.,3 out of 5 stars.
8010,Avene Sunscreen Aqua-fluid SPF50+ 40ml - For Sensitive Skin,Dubs35,"I like how thin the texture of this sunscreen is, it doesn’t feel heavy on the skin. It’s also not greasy and while not matte, has a slightly dewy finish which I don’t mind as it’s not “shiny” on my combo skin. The only issue I have with it is that it leaves quite a white cast on the skin. I’m very pale and even for me, it’s white. I can’t imagine people with deep skin tones liking this. It’s a shame.",3 out of 5 stars.
8011,Avene Sunscreen Aqua-fluid SPF50+ 40ml - For Sensitive Skin,Steph L,"Loved the texture of this product! I usually struggle to find sunscreens that don’t feel like thick body sunscreens. This one is super lightweight and leaves a nice amount of dewiness, not too much shine which I love.",3 out of 5 stars.
8012,Avene Sunscreen Aqua-fluid SPF50+ 40ml - For Sensitive Skin,Beauty89,"I've been using this product for over two weeks. It is lightweight and not greasy which is nice.  However it takes a little longer for the product absorption and leaves a slight grey cast on my skin. The price is abit steep for 40ml. However it does the job well, eventually.",3 out of 5 stars.
8013,Avene Sunscreen Aqua-fluid SPF50+ 40ml - For Sensitive Skin,Keira89,"Very moisturising, non greasy feeling sunscreen protection for your face, for everyday wear. It's great that it goes on non greasy so you can still wear your normal foundation over it. But I did find that the sunscreen was very runny making it a bit messy to use, and it did not have a very pleasant smell. However it does a very good job at protecting my skin from the sun.",3 out of 5 stars.
8014,Avene Sunscreen Aqua-fluid SPF50+ 40ml - For Sensitive Skin,Brittany,I bought this the other day as it was advertised as a thin fluid designed for sensitive skin and it was cheaper than my usual face sunscreen. Positives: it doesn’t have the usual sunscreen smell and is a thin texture. Seems fine for sensitive skin. BUT the worst white cast I’ve ever had with sunscreen. And considering I’m veeeeery pale - then I feel bad for any poor soul with more bronzed skin that purchases this as it just sits on your skin and is hard work to get it to absorb. I wish I’d just paid the extra money and got the La Roche Posay Anthelios fluid sunscreen. Really regret this purchase.,2 out of 5 stars.
8015,Avene Sunscreen Aqua-fluid SPF50+ 40ml - For Sensitive Skin,CKP1,was greasy and beaded off in gross white sweat beads which didn't look very appealing,2 out of 5 stars.
8016,Avene Sunscreen Aqua-fluid SPF50+ 40ml - For Sensitive Skin,Jensu,"I have oily skin so I usually go for gel based sunscreen. This product marketed ultra-lightweight so I was quite excited. It is water based so it's easy to apply, but as you apply, you can tell it still had the density of the sunscreen which meant it's good for sun protection but will definitely give me that shiny look in about an hour - and I was right. I tried using it alone which turned my face shiny and sticky after an hour. I tried it under my make up and it was worst. It made my face look so glossy and still sticky. I believe the sun protection aspect is strong but definitely not suitable for my skin. I tried it for 2 weeks in a row, even when it was cold/cloudy/rainy day. No go for me.",2 out of 5 stars.
8017,Avene Sunscreen Aqua-fluid SPF50+ 40ml - For Sensitive Skin,BrookeH88,"I really wanted to like this SPF as I was looking to change from my current SPF moisturiser. Unfortunately I’m just not a fan of the smell. Being for sensitive skin I can understand it not having a scent added but as is I would not repurchase. On a positive note, it is a lightweight formula that applies easily and doesn’t leave those white streaks you get from thick sunscreen, although it does take a couple of minutes to sink into the skin.",2 out of 5 stars.
8018,Avene Sunscreen Aqua-fluid SPF50+ 40ml - For Sensitive Skin,JMarc,"The eyes sting and how hard it was to work into facial hair make this a pass for me.It's great for sensitive skin as it's calming, non-greasy and won't clog your pores. But be cautious around the eye area if you are prone to eye sensitivity. This would be a good option to wear under makeup. It is silky, weightless and doesn't pill.",2 out of 5 stars.
8019,Avene Sunscreen Aqua-fluid SPF50+ 40ml - For Sensitive Skin,Hopeym,"Very small bottle for the price, only lasts 2 weeks if you’re lucky. Not worth the price, leaves a white finish I’m tan/light brown and it leaves a very obvious white finish even when I try to rub it in",1 out of 5 stars.
8020,Avene Sunscreen Aqua-fluid SPF50+ 40ml - For Sensitive Skin,Hiuy,"This sunscreen is a runny texture and has no fragrance. I am someone who prefers to layer my skincare so under my SPF, I have essence, serum, moisturiser. I used a teaspoon of this, as suggested for all sunscreens and unfortunately found this to have white cast. I have combo, oily and textured skin. Unfortunately this is not for me and I wouldn't recommend it.",1 out of 5 stars.

I was given Avene Hydrance boost to try and it certainly did the job. It comes in a small glass bottle with a little dropper thst helps you deliver the right amount if product to your skin. The product itself is a light oil. I just added a drop to each cheek and forehead and massaged into my skin. It felt so smooth to apply and although a little sticky when first applied it absorbs really quickly leaving no stickiness.  I was able to apply my make up straight after. I definitely noticed a difference in my skin quite quickly. It looked more hydrated, soft and glowing after only a few uses. If you are looking to give your skin that extra boost, especially in the morning  Avene is the one for you. I have used it for weeks now with no bad reactions and I am about to replace my bottle.

8053,Avene Hydrance Boost Concentrated Hydrating Serum 30ml,CamdenBabe,"[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I’ve been using this for a couple of weeks now and so far I’m very impressed. The serum is packaged beautifully in a transparent glass bottle with a dropper pipette. It dispenses just the right amount for full face and neck application with no mess.The serum itself has a pleasant and subtle scent and a lightweight water/gel texture which absorbs quickly. There’s no tackiness or oiliness and the product glides effortlessly across the skin. Hyaluronic acid and B3 are the main ingredients that really make a difference to skin appearance. My skin is combination and a little dry. I have fine lines and a few prominent wrinkles. The Hyaluronic acid really helps with these issues. I notice a difference upon application. My skin looks more supple and smooth, less dry and plumper. The B3 (niacinamide) helps prevent water loss which is something I look for as I do struggle with dehydrated skin. It’s made my skin feel constantly moisturised and improved the texture. Again reducing fine lines and wrinkles. My skin looks so much healthier, radiant and dewy. To sum up this is a serum I will permanently add to my skincare routine. I’ve experienced a noticeable difference in appearance and feel. My skin looks dewy and feels nourished. I feel this is a product worth using. I use it morning and night and also alone or under makeup. It’s given me a confidence boost and better skin.",5 out of 5 stars.

I suffer from dry skin, especially during winter, and I've tried loads of products to try and keep moisturised, and I was amazed at how just a drop of this product can moisturise such a large area! I used it only hands, where they had been cracking due to the cold, and added about 4 drops on each hand, and it was too much, I only needed a couple, as my hands quickly absorbed the moisturiser and my hands instantly felt better.I wasn't expecting it to last long, but I was wrong! I put the moisturiser on my hands at bedtime, and when I woke up in the morning, my hands still felt soft and not dry at all, so that's pretty impressive.I like that it doesn't leave a greasy or sticky residue, as some products can, it just absorbed and moisturised the skin, which is great!I have some age, and dry spots on my face and will be trying this on those as well to see if it helps; I'm feeling optimistic!

I have less flakey skin and less redness.The liquid is clear and the consistency is like hand gel, once you've rubbed it in it evaporates and doesn't leave anything behind. It doesn't have a strong smell, which is a welcome change to other scented mositurisers.I'd recommend this if you want something small to put in your bag when you're out and about. Apply it to your face and neck and let it dry like you would with hand gel, and then get on with your day.",4 out of 5 stars.

8108,Avene Hydrance Boost Concentrated Hydrating Serum 30ml,VK88,[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I generally use thicker daily moisturiser but I thought I would give this a try. Just a few drops seem to go a long way and the consistency is really crazy - it feels even wetter than water if that can even be possible. It dries quickly and did leave my skin feeling hydrated. Overall pretty happy with it,4 out of 5 stars.
8109,Avene Hydrance Boost Concentrated Hydrating Serum 30ml,Steph32,[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I was sent this product to review and I really like it. I’ve not used many serums before and now I’ve found one I wouldn’t want to go without! It soaked in quickly without leaving my face sticky to touch and my skin felt noticeably hydrated after using it.,4 out of 5 stars.
8110,Avene Hydrance Boost Concentrated Hydrating Serum 30ml,KerryT,"[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I've used this product for a week or so. It's a large bottle, and the product is clear. It has a pipette in the lid for easy application. I place a few drops around my face and gently massage. The serum absorbs very quickly, and I do apply more on my dry patches of skin. I haven't felt that my skin is very hydrated after using the serum, although it leaves my face with softer feeling skin. I am continuing use of the Avene Serum as I do not think I've used it for long enough, plus I like the way my skin feels when it's applied.",4 out of 5 stars.
8111,Avene Hydrance Boost Concentrated Hydrating Serum 30ml,Angel78,[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] This serum is vegan and sank into my skin really quickly. The serum has a transparent gel-water texture. It provides instant hydration and soothed my skin in the sub zero temperature. I would have preferred a pump to the pipette provided as I found it difficult to use.,4 out of 5 stars.
8112,Avene Hydrance Boost Concentrated Hydrating Serum 30ml,Hazeydaisy,[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Sadly this serum doesn’t seem to suit my skin and seems to sit on the surface and not absorbed - probably just my skin type but it just didn’t suit me sadly - I tried a few times morning or evening but we didn’t get along sorry,3 out of 5 stars.
8113,Avene Hydrance Boost Concentrated Hydrating Serum 30ml,Nellywp,[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I really like the texture of this serum - it's not runny so you can apply to either side of the face with the little pipette before smoothing it in. It absorbs quickly and feels really hydrating especially with a light moisturiser over the top before makeup. My only criticism is that it's scented - so unnecessary! The scent is reasonably pleasant and doesn't linger but it's not an ingredient I like in such a product so I won't be repurchasing when the bottle runs out.,3 out of 5 stars.
8114,Avene Hydrance Boost Concentrated Hydrating Serum 30ml,shaz06,[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] i had this product for over one moth now and its great for my skin. my skin loves it as it feels great after i taken it smooth as a baby bum as they say. so my daughters also like it it and it  great for her skin.,3 out of 5 stars.
8115,Avene Hydrance Boost Concentrated Hydrating Serum 30ml,Micky,"[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] At first impressions I liked the bottle as it is glass and has a good feel to it, but the product itself is ok, not amazing. There is no smell to the serum, it would be nice to be uplifting or refreshing, then upon application the serum to me just feels a bit watery, so had to use more than I usually would with a serum. It does make my skin feel nice, but I wouldn't say it feels or looks any more hydrated.",3 out of 5 stars.
8116,Avene Hydrance Boost Concentrated Hydrating Serum 30ml,Mamachivs,[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I used this serum underneath my normal moisturiser daily and couldn’t really see any difference. I felt it actually dried out my skin more than it gave a hydration boost. It felt nice on and absorbed easily and I like that it used natural spring water as a base but it just wasn’t for me.,3 out of 5 stars.
8117,Avene Hydrance Boost Concentrated Hydrating Serum 30ml,Yorkshirelad,[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I know this is a hydrating serum but it just felt so heavy on my skin and so sticky afterwards even a couple of hours later so I didn’t really like the feeling of it so I wouldn’t continue to use it or recommend unfortunately,2 out of 5 stars.
8118,Avene Hydrance Boost Concentrated Hydrating Serum 30ml,Yorkshirelass,[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I’m an avid user of serums but I wasn’t a fan of this one. It left my skin feeling sticky and a bit of residue left over. Other serums I have used haven’t done this and have left my skin feeling silky smooth which unfortunately this one doesn’t,2 out of 5 stars.

8137,Avene DermAbsolu Comforting Night Balm 40ml - Anti-ageing Moisturiser,Vicky28,I’ve used this a few times now and I like the glow and dewiness it gives my skin. I haven’t been using it long enough to reflect on the effects and results of long term use. The jar is also good for application giving just enough for the face and keeps the product fresh and lasting. However I really don’t enjoy the fragrance it has and am finding it hard to get used to. If I don’t repurchase it will be for that particular reason.,3 out of 5 stars.
8138,Avene Cleanance Cleansing Gel 400ml,Vanessa J.,"This cleanser is definitely for oily skin! I use it during the Summer, (warmer/humid temperatures) as this is when my face is the most oily. I have noticed a decrease in sebum production while using this cleanser. It leaves my face feeling clean and not overly dry. It smells great and I like the consistency. Only con would be at times my face can be a little sensitive to it. However, after following up with a good hydrating serum/cream, that sensitivity feeling goes away. I highly recommend to my oily skin friends !",5 out of 5 stars.

8193,Avene Cleanance Cleansing Gel 400ml,Lalong2,I’ll start by saying I never write reviews. I found this cleanser 5 years ago and haven’t used anything else since. I’m prone to hormonal acne on my chin/jaw and the occasional whitehead on my cheeks. I also have mostly oily skin with dryness on the outer edges of my face. The Cleanance Gel makes my skin feel the cleanest it’s ever been while keeping it soft. It’s the only thing that works to reduce my hormonal breakouts. It also works wonders on the occasional pimple on my shoulders or back. It can be drying in the winter months but I’ll typically load up on the moisturizer/hyaluronic acid to combat that. I’ve suggested this face wash to all of my friends who struggle with acne and they’ve all become believes too. Thank you Avene,5 out of 5 stars.

After Accutane, your skin does start getting slightly oiler and I bought this cleanser so it would be gentle enough to remove excess oil without being overly drying. Overall I am very pleased with how gentle it is and how it washes my skin. It has a nice fresh minty feeling that isn't too strong but feels great. Aesthetically it looks great and the top is nice for traveling. Also, I do enjoy the ingredients used in this cleanser. Overall, I think if you want to try it, go for a smaller size and see how you feel.",5 out of 5 stars.

It really helped to keep my skin hydrated post treatment. When reading that this product was good for eczema I tried it on a leg that always has flare ups. This is the only product that has ever improved my condition and offered serious relief. Other lotions, creams, prescriptions and custom compounds never really offered relief.

8511,Avene XeraCalm A.D Lipid-Replenishing Cream 400ml,Riley,"This past year has been horrible for my family's skin. I think we've really contributed to a lot of our dry skin/eczema skin problems unknowingly, and had gotten it a good bit under control before using Avene, but the dry skin prevailed with a few persistent eczema patches. My persistent patch in my elbow creases, my baby on his ankle and neck, and my son nummular patches on his feet and legs. Our other eczema creams, while very helpful in stopping major flares, just didn't get us all the way. Dr. Dray on yt has this as one of her recommended products for dry skin. Oh. my. goodness. This is the best cream ever. Within a week my skin was so buttery soft. I'm only 35, and my skin was so dry, I was getting some face wrinkles, and had dry acne on top of my eczema. My acne, cleared up. My skin so much smoother. Dryness gone. I am starting to look my age! Everyone has noticed the major improvement, my husband ""Wow, your skin is so soft now!I just want to touch it."" My babies neck eczema, gone. His ankle eczema is still there, but overnight the improvement was unbelievable. My other son still has nummular eczema, that stuff is about a year of a flare on average, so let's not pretend there is any magic, but it's much improved and he also loves his new soft skin. All three of us have greatly improved softness, much less dryness. I will also keep this and another popular brand on hand (starts with v, and ends with anicream). Great product! Bless the makers of this cream!",5 out of 5 stars.

I've been using the XeraCalm cream for almost two years now, and I've finally found my ride-or-die! I use it both AM (with separate sunscreen on top) and PM year round - magically, it doesn't feel too heavy for summer while still being rich enough for winter. This cream is very hydrating but sinks in quickly, so it layers nicely with sunscreen. It doesn't leave me feeling sticky or greasy at all. Plus, a bottle lasts a very long time.",5 out of 5 stars.

8601,Avene XeraCalm A.D Lipid-Replenishing Cream 400ml,Michelle K.,"I bought this bc i was having a sever itchiness all over my face and eyes due to allergies and weather. However since this is not some kind of otc ointment I still had itchiness. Now that allergy season is over, I just like using this as my daily cream in my skincare routine since it is scentless, doesn’t feel greasy, and feels very light while helping retain moisture. So for me, with itchiness it does not help but for moisturizing this is a great product. Also love the dispenser since you can easily control how much product you squeeze out. Fast shipping!",4 out of 5 stars.
8602,Avene XeraCalm A.D Lipid-Replenishing Cream 400ml,Robin L.,If you have dry skin this stuff is amazing! The only reason I gave it a 4 star was because I needed it for my hands .

Be sure to use a small amount that can help with the stickiness.,4 out of 5 stars.

8606,Avene XeraCalm A.D Lipid-Replenishing Cream 400ml,Jacqueline B.,I have not been using this product long enough to see a difference but I do have a complaint about the functionality of the bottle. The lotion is rather thick and either comes out in a dribble down the bottle or tries to shoot halfway across the room. My guess is there something defective in the pump. This makes it frustrating to use and for the price I would think they could find a better pump.,3 out of 5 stars.
8607,Avene XeraCalm A.D Lipid-Replenishing Cream 400ml,Phyllis H.,The crème is too thick to use everyday and does not absorb as well as the balm did . The balm melts right into the skin and I just did not enjoy the consistency of the cream. If you don’t rub enough it leaves a cast like a sunblock. The key just apply small doses I wanted to try the Crème this time. In the future will stay with the balm Just depends what you like Both cream and balm work great for itchy skin,3 out of 5 stars.

8706,Avene SPF 50+  Face and Body  Lotion 100ml,Just Jacs,We found Avene Sunscreen Lotion SPF50+ to be thick but not greasy. A little went along way and for most of us absorbed well. But found with my husband the hotter and sweatier he got the more a white film would appear over him. Biggest plus was the kids enjoyed the scent and none got burnt. Great for sensitive skin.,4 out of 5 stars.

8717,Avene SPF 50+  Face and Body  Lotion 100ml,emily11,I like this sunscreen that is friendly to my sensitive skin. Just a downside that the smell is a bit artificial. Once you get used to it no big problem.,4 out of 5 stars.

8723,Avene SPF 50+  Face and Body  Lotion 100ml,K8isgr8,I'd definitely say this is more of a milk than a cream. It's quite thin and easy to rub in. Didn't feel too greasy once dry. Not a fan of the smell though.,3 out of 5 stars.
8724,Avene SPF 50+  Face and Body  Lotion 100ml,MrsEdwards,"Loved the packaging, smelt okay, nothing too fancy! But was disappointed with the consistency- it was very watery, and needed some extra rubbing into my face to blend it in.",3 out of 5 stars.
8725,Avene SPF 50+  Face and Body  Lotion 100ml,Kell711,I bought this because my usual sunscreen was out of stock. I have sensitive skin and this did not burn my skin or around my eyes but it leaves a white cast and I’ve found it does pill a little bit under my makeup. I won’t be repurchasing but it’s a good sunscreen for just hanging out at home,3 out of 5 stars.
8726,Avene SPF 50+  Face and Body  Lotion 100ml,CrescentY,It’s quite white and shiny on face it’s ok I probably will not repurchase for the price I was hoping for better quality,3 out of 5 stars.
8727,Avene SPF 50+  Face and Body  Lotion 100ml,bougieanhmay,"Bought this due to the brand reputation and reviews I've read on here. Being a fan of sunscreen since my teenage time (I'm now 30), this sunscreen did not impress me much given its price. Not being bias, some good sides about it: moisturising (it's lotion/cream based)- lathering well- unscented- not irritating skin (except eyes). Some not-so-good sides: extreme white cast (given applied correct amount/ reapplying/ and I'm asian with white pale skin tone it's still white) - with second application it starts to mess up around, spilled off, creating a thick visible layer on your face - it does sting the eyes (combination sunscreen) It does also stain clothes white hence I can't use it as body spf.",2 out of 5 stars.
8728,Avene SPF 50+  Face and Body  Lotion 100ml,Renata_s02,"I really wanted to love this sunscreen, as I love the Avene brand, and had seen positive reviews. But this sunscreen is very overpriced for what it is, and leaves a horrible white cast. I've tried a lot of sunscreens both chemical and physical, and this has the worst cast I've ever experienced. I would expect this cast if the sunscreen was physical, but this is chemical, so I don't understand why it's so bad.You can't wear it on your face or under makeup. It's good as a gentle sunscreen, and if you're prepared to look like a ghost, then this is fine. But unfortunately I would not repurchase, as there are much better SPF 50 sunscreens around.",2 out of 5 stars.

8998,Avene Gentle Milk Cleanser 200ml,Alisha S,I love using cleansers to help take off my makeup / excess makeup and this definitely did the job along with making my skin feel super clean & no weird residues were left which was great!,4 out of 5 stars.
8999,Avene Gentle Milk Cleanser 200ml,Friendstar,"This cleanser is so gentle, soothing and yet still provides that clean feeling without over-drying the skin. I’m used to a harsher cleanser so it took a little getting used to its mildness but after a few weeks, I won’t be going back. The scent is fresh and clean and somehow even SMELLS gentle? I really adore the packaging too; the long tall bottle with pump dispenser makes it super easy to keep in the shower amongst all the other essentials. Overall I would recommend this product for those with or without skin concerns who like a gentle cleanse.",4 out of 5 stars.
9000,Avene Gentle Milk Cleanser 200ml,SkincareObsessed,The consistency of this feels light on application (on dry skin) but in performance its rich. It is effective at removing makeup without stinging my eyes or drying out my skin. I remove with warm washcloth and skin doesn’t feel tight or dry at all. Also use this for a morning cleanse as it cleanses and nourishes my skin well. This was gifted to me by Avene.,4 out of 5 stars.

I thin its always worth trying something new. I did t mind this product. I normally was my make up off with face wash and face cloth which I did and then used this afterwards to take any excess off which it did. I do quite like the fact of adding an extra to my regime so my face felt even smoother after usage.",4 out of 5 stars.

9013,Avene Gentle Milk Cleanser 200ml,Gracef,"[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I’ve used this product a couple of times and seems like a lovely product. Something I would definitely purchase and explore the full product range. i would say however that the sample size was very small; I find to really see the full effects it’s best to try skincare products for my face over a few weeks. It also needed to be a squeezable bottle rather than just an open top, as it was hard to get the right amount out.",4 out of 5 stars.
9014,Avene Gentle Milk Cleanser 200ml,Emjay,[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] The Avenue gentle milk cleanser is extremely gentle on my skin.

Unfortunately I feel like it’s not a great remover of makeup however it does work with my sensitive skin. The only issue I find is I’m having to use a makeup wipe after for full removal,3 out of 5 stars.
9019,Avene Gentle Milk Cleanser 200ml,Elzoz,"[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] The cleanser took off make up reasonably well but when trying to take eye make up off, it took it off my eyelashes and it just sat stuck to my skin under my eyes and wouldn’t come off even when using a fresh amount of the cleanser. Therefore I would not recommend the product to use on the eye area.However, it took face make up off and felt like it was good for sensitive skin with no irritation. I would recommend taking off with cotton wool rather than with water.",3 out of 5 stars.
9020,Avene Gentle Milk Cleanser 200ml,Izzy,"[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] This is alright for a gentle clean on no makeup days. Doesn't remove makeup alone, and avoid using on the eyes. It's moisturising, and good for sensitive skin, I'm just not sure it really does much. Has a fragrance",3 out of 5 stars.
9021,Avene Gentle Milk Cleanser 200ml,Carol M.,The bottle squirts out at an odd angle. Hard to control the cleanser. Like the cleanser but very disappointed in the bottle.,3 out of 5 stars.
9022,Avene Gentle Milk Cleanser 200ml,Alexis E.,"Though this isn’t important to the product’s capabilities I don’t like the scent, and it’s a wash off product so it’s not a big deal. I had never used a milk cleanser like this before, it honestly feels like rubbing a lotion on my face. I prefer putting it dry on my skin then washing with the water. I wish it lathered more but I feel since it’s a milk cleanser it isn’t supposed to. I think it seems like a nice product but I am unsure how I feel it is as a cleanser. It reminds me of an oil cleanser cause of its thickness so sometimes I feel I should use a second cleanser. I want to love this product but I don’t know yet.",3 out of 5 stars.
9023,Avene Gentle Milk Cleanser 200ml,Leigh S.,This cleanser is pretty good. Only problem I have with it is the scent. Products for sensitive skin should not have any fragrance added. Scent is kind of strong,3 out of 5 stars.
9024,Avene Gentle Milk Cleanser 200ml,Shell85,"[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I received this product and thought it was an OK product, it took a few attempts to wipe my mascara off but it did eventually work.It didn't irritate my skin as I suffer with sensitive skin, all in all left my skin soft to touch",3 out of 5 stars.
9025,Avene Gentle Milk Cleanser 200ml,hanz90,"[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I've tried so many cleansers depending on my skin at the time. My skins currently pretty dry and sensitive so I was hoping this would help to.revive the dullness a little and bring it back to life. Its a nice cleanser and applies lovely to the skin. Not a foaming cleanser which I'm not used to but that's not an issue. After rinsing off I was hoping for better results though. My skin did feel a little softer but nothing major. Overall, haven't really seen much difference to my skin.",3 out of 5 stars.
9026,Avene Gentle Milk Cleanser 200ml,Beauty2021,[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] This make up remover is very gentle.It doesn't irritate sensitive skin and it doesn't remove waterproof mascara. The consistency is quite thick and it feels nice on the skin.It will be probably ok for someone who doesn't use mascara and very little make up.,3 out of 5 stars.
9027,Avene Gentle Milk Cleanser 200ml,Michelle,"I absolutely loved the Milk Cleanser for dry to very dry skin that came in a pump that you rinsed off. Now they changed the formula and added soy in it. Ladies beware. Soy is a phytoestrogen and as such builds estrogen in your body which is a cause for breast cancer. Same with evening primrose and borage oil. Yet skin care companies are now putting these ingredients in their products. I know a 35 year old that was getting hot flashes and her doctor asked to see her moisturizer and sure enough it had soy in it. Now they ruined one of the best milk cleansers by adding soy in it so I'm on the lookout for a new one. I won't buy this again. And it's pretty fishy that they are keeping the ingredients off of the website, but when you get your bottle you will see it on there. Ladies, take care of yourself and always look at to see that soy and evening primrose and borage oil and wild yam are not in your skin care.",2 out of 5 stars.
9028,Avene Gentle Milk Cleanser 200ml,Megan,Leaves skin feeling sticky after taking off and is not easy to remove with just a cotton pad without tugging at the skin. The extreme cleanser that they discontinued was much better than this.,2 out of 5 stars.
9029,Avene Gentle Milk Cleanser 200ml,Christina K.,"I really wanted to love this one but it has started to sting and burn my face after just several days use. During the time I was able to use it, I found that it removed my waterproof eye makeup well. It did not do so well removing all traces of my foundation of which I wear a very light amount to even out my skin tone. I did like how my skin felt moisturized after using this cleanser but unfortunately, I reacted poorly to something in this product and have had to discontinue use.",2 out of 5 stars.

9031,Avene Gentle Milk Cleanser 200ml,Sharon C.,"I really hoped this would work for me, even though it was for a person with dry skin. I have combination skin on my face and allergies to anything from coconut, olive oil, preservatives etc. I saw nothing in the ingredient list that I new would bother my skin, so I tried it. Unfortunately it caused acne on my face, probably from the mineral oil and or the perfume. It smells nice, but I don't understand why you would want to put ingredients (perfumes) in your products, that people with sensitive skin would not be able to use. Fortunately, I did not have to return it, as my husband has dry skin and is using it with no problems. He says he likes it and his face is not so dry now.",2 out of 5 stars.

9036,Avene Gentle Milk Cleanser 200ml,Emily Hope McG,"[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] This has to be the worst product I’ve tried as in regards to makeup removing and cleansing, milk cleansers are usually my favourite but this was just awful at doing what it’s supposed to. I used this in the evening after wearing a full-face for 9 hours during my shift as per usual and it didn’t tackle my non-waterproof mascara or foundation as just seemed to smear it around my face rather than actually removing the deposits. Would not recommend this to anyone looking for a milk cleanser as this is just awful and had to use my trusted one afterwards.",1 out of 5 stars.
9037,Avene Gentle Milk Cleanser 200ml,Mayra Z.,"I bought this mainly because I wanted to double cleanse since I do wear a full face of makeup(foundation, concealer, eyeshadow, mascara, highlight etc). This product says it removes makeup but it doesn’t fully remove makeup which is sad. Also, I don’t like how it’s like a lotion type cleanser, I would of preferred a regular cleanser that foams up. I recommend this product only if you don’t really wear makeup.",1 out of 5 stars.

9091,Avene Gentle Toning Lotion 200ml - Toner for Dry skin,Patricia,I have been using toner as part of my skincare regimen all of my adult life. It's tricky finding one that preps the skin for moisturizers without drying it out. This product is a 5-star winner! The name says it all: gentle toning lotion. Clears and preps my skin gently without any trace of residue. I use it after washing with XeraCalm Cleansing Oil and before moisturizing with XeraCalm Balm or Cream. Highly recommended!,5 out of 5 stars.

9108,Avene Gentle Toning Lotion 200ml - Toner for Dry skin,Trenton W.,"The reason that I originally purchased this product was due to the Avène website stating that this product is suitable for all skin types. However, the bottle clearly states “Dry to very dry skin”, which made me leery to purchase the product. However, I decided to give it a try andI confirmed my concerns. This product is much too hydrating for those of us with “Normal to Oily” skin. My complexion felt sticky. I feel that the Avène Mineral spray is a more suitable choice.",3 out of 5 stars.

I live in a super dry climate and my under eyes were flaking…this saved me!

9228,Avene Hyaluron Activ B3 Multi-Intensive Night Cream 40ml,Maggie 43,"[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] the composition is good which is not so typical for this brand. A big plus for retinal in the composition, it has a faster action than retinol, while causing a lower risk of side effects. therefore it is a better choice for sensitive skin, it is a pity that this retinal is not included in the composition. The cream is not greasy, spreads well, but for me 2 pumps are not enough for the face and neck. after 2 weeks of use, fine wrinkles are clearly shallower, the skin has a nice glow in the morning, it looks nourished. I recommend this cream.",5 out of 5 stars.

9241,Avene Hyaluron Activ B3 Multi-Intensive Night Cream 40ml,Torthecatlady,"[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I hadn’t tried anything by Avene before trying this night cream, but I was really pleased with it. I’m in my 30s and starting to notice some creases in my forehead and light wrinkles starting to form so needed to switch up my moisturiser to something to help with signs of aging. The cream is lovely and thick and slightly scented with a slightly orange colour to it. Twist the lid of the jar to activate and press down on the lid to release the cream. It leaves my skin feeling silky and smooth and after just a few days my skin is definitely already improving. I have a very oily complexion and often find I wake up with oil on my pillow, however I am definitely less oily when using this cream. I will be looking to add more products from this Avene range to build up my skincare routine starting with the day cream. Would definitely recommend, very impressed.",5 out of 5 stars.

The cream smells nice and I’ve found that a little goes a long way. I love the built in pump function of the jar and although at first 1 pump can seem a tiny amount it spreads very well. I was a little surprised by the colour, I assumed it would be pure white. It has had a slight affect to my face in this time but not as much as I would have hoped. However, this could be due to me working the night shift so alternating when to put it on when I’m at work vs off work means time of application and regularity varies. I’ll continue to use though and see how I get on once it’s all gone!",3 out of 5 stars.

9297,Avene Day Protector Tinted BB Cream SPF30+ 40ml - Tinted moisturiser for sensitive skin,BilboTeaBaggins,"I’m a 16M with oily and sensitive skin type. I have acne-prone skin and a moderate amount of acne scars (PIH).I bought this product thinking it would do a great job of covering up the scars and blending them in with my skin. I was wrong. Although applying the product in small amounts and liberally the tint was little to no use as it barely did anything (I tried applying with a good amount and it ended up looking like it was caked onto my face). You could still see the dark blemishes on my face and it looks as if you just applied standard sunscreen.However, the product did a good job at protecting my skin from the sun and is water resistant. Thankfully it blended with my skin colour a few mins after applying otherwise I would look like a drag queen.My last takeaway from this product is that if you’re looking for an all-in-one product then this would be an alright choice (IMO). Otherwise, I’d suggest you just layer your products with a standard moisturiser and sunscreen. The SPF in this product is alright but the tint not so much. If tint is what you’re looking for in this product then don’t be surprised if you are disappointed like I am.",2 out of 5 stars.

9445,Avene Cicalfate Hand Repair Barrier Cream 100ml - Hand cream for Sensitive skin,Snowhail,[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I like that the cream is fragrance free and you only need a small amount. The packaging is good for travelling and is a decent size. However it can be a little greasy and doesn’t last very long. I found I needed to reapply throughout the day but it does make my hands very soft.,4 out of 5 stars.
9446,Avene Cicalfate Hand Repair Barrier Cream 100ml - Hand cream for Sensitive skin,silver,"[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] The hand cream is relatively thick so its quite moisturising and not oily at all. Its scentless which is a bonus for me and doesnt have a weird ""scentless"" smell that some scentless hand creams have. Only downside I'd say is that it doesnt immediately hydrate your hands, will need to apply the hand cream a few times for it to start working.",4 out of 5 stars.

9475,Avene Hyaluron Activ B3 Renewal Firming Cream 50ml,Anonymous,"[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Just wanted to stop by and leave a review for what I think is one of the best skin care products on the market for me. I've just recently started using products from French skincare brand Avene and I am so impressed by the products themselves, the design and the sustainable nature of their packaging materials.The cream itself contains both Hyaluron and active B3 ingredients which have been proven to regenerate skin and stimulate the skin cells, making skin more elastic. I've found the cream to be a lovely soft texture that is easily absorbed by the skin and it isnt oily or greasy in any way, and I use this as a moisturiser  and day cream, when I wash my face in the morning I'll put this on straight afterwards. I would definitely recommend adding this to your skincare regime. I'll certainly be buying more in the future. I'm very impressed.Another thing I really like about this is that all of the ingredients used in the cream are of natural origin and it is free from any animal products. Also I'd like to mention the packaging and design... the cream itself comes in a pod that is placed inside a recyclable/re-usable glass jar, which I think is great and a lot more environmentally conscious that a lot of other products you see on the market today. Thanks Avéne!",5 out of 5 stars.

My skin has felt really soft and smooth and texture and tone are improved as well. There are 2 minor things to point out, the plastic inner pot which is the part that can be purchased as a refill just site in the pot and doesn’t seem to click in at all so it does move about a bit, not really an issue but just to note.

9514,Avene Hyaluron Activ B3 Renewal Firming Cream 50ml,Lucielucie87,"[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] This day cream is quite good, it runs in really easy and keeps my face feeling moisturised for most of the day. It's only downfall is that once I've gone through my weekly skincare regime it does stink when I apply this.",4 out of 5 stars.
9515,Avene Hyaluron Activ B3 Renewal Firming Cream 50ml,Fifi90,"[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I used this product for a couple of weeks but as someone with really sensitive skin, it really didn’t agree with me. Some products make my face flare up with red dry patches and this was one of those, so I had to stop using it. I did like the original glow it gave me at the start, but it just wasn’t compatible with my skin type in the end. I gave it to my boyfriend and he has been using it since and has been getting on well with it and seeing results, less wrinkly and more hydrated.",3 out of 5 stars.
9516,Avene Hyaluron Activ B3 Renewal Firming Cream 50ml,Amelie22,"[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I love avene so much and most of my skincare is from the tolerance range, I wanted to love this so much but unfortunately it really irritated my sensitive skin and totally broke me out. My partner tried it however and found it to be fine for them. Perhaps not for those with very sensitive skin",3 out of 5 stars.
9517,Avene Hyaluron Activ B3 Renewal Firming Cream 50ml,Bownie,[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] This cream when first applied left my normal dry skin feeling fresh and smooth however as the day went on my skin felt greasy and dirty and I cannot say I really want to use this daily but it has made my skin feel differently each morning and it doesn't seem as dry but during the day it does feel greaser so I'm unsure on weather I like this cream or not,3 out of 5 stars.
9518,Avene Hyaluron Activ B3 Renewal Firming Cream 50ml,Saspip,"[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] The pros: nice looking jar, really like that the plastic insert inside is recyclable and then you can just buy a new one to pop in the glass jar. There is a little routine inside the box itself, not on extra leaflet, that you can follow if you’re the type of person that has time to carefully rub in your moisturiser. Fragrance is ok, a bit too strong for me, I prefer something really neutral. The cons: this claims to be a perfect base for make up but it has no SPF in it which is non-negotiable for me. When I applied a tinted moisturiser with SPF on top my skin felt a bit gritty, like the tinted moisturiser mixed badly with the moisturiser below. As a result, I have only worn this at night since. My skin is fine, looks no worse but doesn’t look any better either. Overall I’d say it’s a perfectly average moisturiser.",3 out of 5 stars.

9530,Avene Revitalising Nourishing Cream 50ml - Moisturiser for Dry sensitive skin,Melissa H.,"This is the best moisturizer I've ever used in my life, this is the 2nd time I get it and I will never go back. I have combination skin (very oily in the t-zone and very dry/sensitive skin in the rest of my face) and it works throughout the seasons. I love the soft texture and the richness (not too rich), it spreads out beautifully and it's non-comedogenic, I have way less texture in my face (also because of the rest of my skincare routine) I'm usually not a fan of flowery/powdery scents but this one is perfect since it doesn't linger and dissipates shortly after the skin absorbs it.",5 out of 5 stars.

The cream sits in a 50ml sealed jar and can be scooped out and applied with the little spatula supplied to you within the box.  Beautifully soft, the creams feel velvety when applied to my face.  I love that it glides smooth and that it feels light on my skin being absorbed quickly and not greasy.  Minor dry areas on my face felt nourished and hydrated while the gentle ingredients did not irritate my skin.  You would enjoy this product if your facial skin needs to feel softer and add some suppleness to dry and uncomfortable sensitive skin.",5 out of 5 stars.

My skin is not dry, however not oily either so I feel like this product gives my skin a good balance of moisture to my skin, leaving it feeling nourished and soft and over the past few weeks looking more myself again, if not better!I found the product a sorbed into my skin fairly quickly. It definitely soaked in well overnight and I could notice a good amount of difference in how my skin looked and felt the next day.There is no big overpowering smell to the cream, in face I barely smelt any fragrance at all.

It initially feels like quite a heavy face cream but it goes on so smoothly and has such a light silky feel once absorbed into my face. This cream has been an absolute life saver during this winter as I get dry flaky skin around my nose and lips but have not struggled with dry skin at all with daily use. Also haven't noticed my skin being oily or any breakouts with continued daily use. No reaction on my somewhat sensitive skin. My skin looks healthier, softer and it seems to have also minimized my fine lines, what a win! The fragrance is also clean and subtle. Would recommend as a great all-rounder, every-day moisturiser for those who have slightly dryer, combination-skin.",5 out of 5 stars.

9621,Avene Revitalising Nourishing Cream 50ml - Moisturiser for Dry sensitive skin,Friendstar,I really really love this cream! It strikes the perfect balance between nourishing and revitalizing whilst being light and non-greasy. The cream absorbs quickly but leaves my skin feeling super hydrated. I appreciate the non-comedogenic formula and have noticed a slight blurring of my skin texture after continuous use.

9647,Avene Revitalising Nourishing Cream 50ml - Moisturiser for Dry sensitive skin,Anonymous,"I've been applying the Revitalizing Nourishing Cream every morning and evening as I haven't been wearing make up whilst working from home. I've noticed my skin feel instantly  hydrated, nourished and definitely no signs of dryness.I love the natural Berry Extract which is only mild in smell but feels smoothing and definitely feels like a skin barrier protecting me and felt as though my skin has been somewhat restored. I definitely prefer skincare products that include Vitamin E, which helps to protect the skin against external nasties and vitamins are always great for the skin. Another thing I liked about the ingredients was that it is very rich in Thermal Spring Water for its soothing and anti-irritating properties.However,  the cream promotes being 'non-greasy' and rapidly absorbed, I would have to disagree, I actually felt the product on my face and slightly greasy even hours after application but I do feel that this cream has felt like it's provided long-lasting nourishment.My skin definitely does feel nourished, more radiant and has helped me with signs of tired looking skin as I've now got a healthy and glowing complexion.",5 out of 5 stars.

9651,Avene Revitalising Nourishing Cream 50ml - Moisturiser for Dry sensitive skin,Katieloves,"I received the Eau Thermale Avène Revitalizing Nourishing Cream as part of the BH trial team. My skin is normal-dry and I have just started experiencing skin sensitivity (ah, the joys of post-partum). Here are some features that I would like to highlight about my experience with the product:- The packaging is a light-weight, yet sturdy acrylic jar, although it is not easily recyclable;- No SPF, although I am yet to find the perfect day cream that has decent SPF;- Can be used in the day or evening; perfect for those minimalists!- No detectable fragrance;- No fancy-schmancy ingredients like retinol, vitamin c, hydrolytic acid or unicorn tears. This isn’t too much of a concern for me as I am happy to age gracefully (read, I am too lazy/too tired to bother);- The cream was perfectly suitable for my dry and dehydrated skin. My face immediately felt soft after application and my dry patches were kept at bay. The cream also absorbed nicely although I can’t comment in whether it affected make-up application because #isolife;- I personally didn’t experience any skin sensitivity when using this product; and- Readily available and often on sale!This product gets a big tick from me and I would happily purchase this with my own money in the future.",5 out of 5 stars.
9652,Avene Revitalising Nourishing Cream 50ml - Moisturiser for Dry sensitive skin,xCherrybliss,"This is a fantastic nourishing cream for dry skin, perfect for the cold winter weather. Usually in Winter, my skin is so dry and gets flakey due to the cold so I tend to slather on thick layers of creams. This avene cream is thick and buttery, feels really comforting on my dry skin. I love that it is creamy and spreads very easily. The cream is filled with antioxidants and the avene water providing hydrating and moisture to the skin.The cream comes in a jar with a spatula making it very easy to dispense. Usually i find jar packaging a bit unhygienic but given the thick, buttery formula, it makes more sense that its in a jar.After using it for the last two weeks, my skin is noticeably softer and it doesn't feel tight or dry. The cream works really well even on my sensitive skin and I find that it is very soothing on my skin and strengthens my skin barrier.",5 out of 5 stars.

The little jar is white and glossy and looks very nice on my makeup counter.A little bit goes a long way, when I first received the product to trial I used way more than I needed which just shows this product will actually last a decent amount of time.It is a thicker moisturiser which melts into the skin quickly and left my face feeling so juicy and plump until nighttime which I found really impressive.Makeup layers ontop beautifully and it even replaced my need to use a primer so I can’t complain about that!This really impressed me. My skin is fairly normal to dehydrated and this will be a staple for me for the next few months as well as the perfect overnight treatment for my skin when it needs an extra boost.",5 out of 5 stars.
9654,Avene Revitalising Nourishing Cream 50ml - Moisturiser for Dry sensitive skin,Katsuss,"I was looking forward to trialling this product as my skin has been looking particularly dull, and dehydrated after a long summer and coming into winter. I've also been suffering from some congestion around my mouth and eyebrows which meant I needed to do some additional work with clay masks and AHAs for exfoliation. This cream was the perfect way to inject moisture back into my sensitive skin, plumping it beautifully.The cream comes in a chic glass jar with a spatula to ensure good hygiene. The actual product has a lovely soft fragrance which didn't seem to irritate my skin at all. My skin is usually sensitive to fragrances which cause break outs.The cream is thick and rich but non-greasy and absorbs easily into your skin instantly nourishing it.I have been using it in the  morning and evening after cleansing and applying serums.

I will only say the spatula does the job but does look and feel very cheap.The cream itself is amazing. My skin just drank it in. Within minutes of applying it had sunk in ready for my sunscreen.It soothed my very sensitive skin and actively helped dry patches I had on my upper cheeks.It did not cause my face to sting or react badly in any way, I usually have a few days of that happening before my face accepts new skincare.The feeling of plump hydrated skin lasted all day, and after applying at night I'd wake in the morning feeling as though it were freshly applied.I would only recommend this cream to people who have normal to dry skin, it really is a moisture hit.It did not cause any breakouts which was wonderful.",5 out of 5 stars.
9656,Avene Revitalising Nourishing Cream 50ml - Moisturiser for Dry sensitive skin,BeautyKrysus,"I have always found my skin difficult to find the right products for as it is sensitive (rosacea), blemish prone and dry (especially dry where I have blemishes healing). While using this Avene moisturiser, my skin has improved drastically in a short amount of time. My dry patches are almost completely gone,  my skin is less red overall, my blemishes are fewer and the ones that I had before using the product have been healing much better, and with less redness. The product sinks into the skin really well and leaves your face very soft and supple. I feel that my skin has looked more radiant and smooth in photos which has really boosted my confidence. The jar is a good size and the product goes a long way, I appreciated that it came with a small scoop to use when getting moisturiser out of the jar. The texture and smell of the moisturiser reminds me of sunscreen (not quite as greasy, and the smell is very subtle). Overall, this product has had the hugest impact on my skin out of all the individual products I've tried, and it really makes me want to try more products from Avene. This product is amazing for dry skin now that we are close to Winter, and I will definitely continue using this product.",5 out of 5 stars.

Although it is quite an expensive moisturiser, I do believe that a good quality moisturiser goes a long way.The product itself comes in a beautiful round tub which almost looks like glass, and a small flat scooping tool that is perfect as it enables you to never touch the product by hand when scooping it out. I believe every moisturiser should have one!You can tell by the quality of it as soon as you scoop the tiniest amount which goes a long way. It has a beautiful cream like scent which is not overpowering, as some moisturiser can have a strange strong smell.When applied, the moisturiser glides onto your face smoothly and makes you feel refreshed. I have dry skin and believe that it sits wonderfully on my skin and does not make my face oily either.The scent and texture of it keeps you wanting to apply more although a little goes a long way.I was using this with the Avène thermal spring water and the ordinary serum and putting the moisturiser on last.Can not fault this product",5 out of 5 stars.

I was super excited to be apart of this trial as I have heard so many good things about Avene.The revitalising nourishing cream has some fanstasic ingredients, there are so many benefits for this product. The cream made my skin look radiant and glows I was shocked at the look of my skin. I haven’t been using make up lately and this has just boosted my skin. It’s super hydrating and you don’t need any other product like serum or anything. The overall apprearance of my skin looks fresh and glowy. It left my skin feel refreshed and moisturised but not sticky. It absorbed really well into my skin. I was a little worried at first because of the scents that it would effect my skin but it didn’t. I have super dry sentsive skin and I’m always worried that new products will affect my skins and both the mask and creams did not affect or irritate my skin at all.

I also found that my redness was slightly less after application.Additionally, I usually have the issue that when I try new creams they can cause congestion on my forehead and this has not occurred using the Avene Nourishing and Soothing cream.The packaging comes with a spatula for hygiene which is helpful for not being wasteful and using the correct amount of product.Overall I am satisfied with this product, will continue to use it and would recommend to people with the target skin types.",5 out of 5 stars.

I’ve been using the product twice a day (morning and evening) after deep cleansing and it has left my skin feeling soft, smooth and revitalized. I’ve been pairing this cream with Avene’s Soothing Radiance Mask for twice the hydration and radiance.I’ve seen this brand on the shelves but haven’t had the opportunity to try any of the products before. I’d definitely recommend this product if you are looking  for a cream which boosts hydration and re-energizes tired, dull and dry looking skin.",5 out of 5 stars.
9664,Avene Revitalising Nourishing Cream 50ml - Moisturiser for Dry sensitive skin,Kenny C.,"Very cosmetically elegant. Nice slip. Moisturizing enough. However, I think that the fragrance is too strong, docking 1 star.",4 out of 5 stars.
9665,Avene Revitalising Nourishing Cream 50ml - Moisturiser for Dry sensitive skin,Lisa L.,"I like Avene products as my skin is very sensitive and they have never caused irritation, I also have dry skin and decided to try this moisturiser.  It comes in a lightweight plastic tub and has a spatula for application.  It's a fairly lightweight cream and I am used to dry skin moisturisers that have a balm consistency , so I think that's one of the reasons why I felt it did'nt hydrate my skin enough. It could be that I underestimated how dry my skin is and a product for very dry skin is more suited to me.  So I use this during the day and apply a heavier moisturiser at night ( Avene skin recovery balm). I think this is fine for normal to dry sensitive skin, or might make a good night cream for someone who does'nt like oily or heavy face creams.  It's o.k,  but not suited to my skin especially over the winter months.",4 out of 5 stars.
9666,Avene Revitalising Nourishing Cream 50ml - Moisturiser for Dry sensitive skin,Allison W.,This does feel nice but it doesn’t seem to absorb into my skin. It sort of sits on top and makes it look greasy.,4 out of 5 stars.
9667,Avene Revitalising Nourishing Cream 50ml - Moisturiser for Dry sensitive skin,Deeann S.,I love this product! I’ve turned many clients on to it. The texture and feel is very lovely. My only downside was it caused some breakouts. I suppose it’s too rich for my skin type but it certainly feels good going on!,4 out of 5 stars.
9668,Avene Revitalising Nourishing Cream 50ml - Moisturiser for Dry sensitive skin,Francoise E.,Simply love this cream. Rich but yet very light. I like the way it is absorbed into the skin rapidly. I never feel like I have greasy skin.,4 out of 5 stars.

9672,Avene Revitalising Nourishing Cream 50ml - Moisturiser for Dry sensitive skin,ErinL,"Love Avène products, and this one is no exception.

9673,Avene Revitalising Nourishing Cream 50ml - Moisturiser for Dry sensitive skin,sanch,"I loved this cream since the moment I opened it! Not only does the packaging feel so luxurious but the cream has an amazing texture and isn't too scented. After using this product for about two weeks, I can see how hydrated and how much smoother my skin is looking. I am in love.",4 out of 5 stars.
9674,Avene Revitalising Nourishing Cream 50ml - Moisturiser for Dry sensitive skin,LeahP,"So, I know that Avene does a lot of great products, which I love, but this one has to be one of their best yet! This hydrating cream comes in a jar, which has a nice and firm heft to it, and the product is easy to scoop out of the packaging.I love that this glides over the face really well, without feeling too thick and doesn’t just sit on the skin. This really does help with the winter dryness, and at a reasonable price!",4 out of 5 stars.
9675,Avene Revitalising Nourishing Cream 50ml - Moisturiser for Dry sensitive skin,Anonymous,I use this product after I take off my daily makeup and it has nourished my skin. The product is lightweight and doesn’t leave my skin greasy or anything. Highly recommend.,4 out of 5 stars.
9676,Avene Revitalising Nourishing Cream 50ml - Moisturiser for Dry sensitive skin,emiliestevensss,"Such a beautiful, soft, fluffy and dreamy moisturiser. This beauty is lovely and lightweight yet with a comfortable density that leaves my skin feeling hydrated and moisturised all day, without being too rich. Performs beautifully with other serums/products and also a lovely base before makeup. I've been using it consistently each morning for about 3 weeks, my skin feels nice and bouncy, hydrated and soft afterwards and i enjoy the light + creamy fresh scent. This moisturiser is a great all rounder and very kind to sensitive or dry skins, would recommend!",4 out of 5 stars.

9678,Avene Revitalising Nourishing Cream 50ml - Moisturiser for Dry sensitive skin,Yohanna,"Love the packaging , sturdy glass jar. Cream feels lightweight and sets into the skin fast. Feels very moisturizing and quenching. I used this cream on my neck and chest. As I do not  wear basic creams on my face as my skin there does not need extra hydration or oils or oclusive barrier. Though love using the creams on my neck and chest, as skin there is delicate and does not have such a generous oil/sebum production as my face skin has. Have noticed that keeps my skin hydrated and there is no crepey look after I have slept for hours on side overnight. Skin just bounces back after being squished, and keeps looking and feeling smooth and soft.",4 out of 5 stars.
9679,Avene Revitalising Nourishing Cream 50ml - Moisturiser for Dry sensitive skin,Anonymous,"I preferred this product before they made the switch from the glass packaging to the current packaging. Before the change, the scent was very light and was my holy grail product and the only moisturizer I could repurchase again and again. Now the fragrance is quite strong and almost an entirely different scent altogether. I find that it doesn't feel as nourishing as it once did. Will probably be looking for another product to replace it.",4 out of 5 stars.
9680,Avene Revitalising Nourishing Cream 50ml - Moisturiser for Dry sensitive skin,neha.gamine,"I have dry, sensitive skin which is prone to breakouts and finding a product that helps soothe the breakouts while not being too drying is difficult. I tried the Avene revitalizing nourishing cream and really liked it. It comes in the classic Avene white box and the jar inside looks really luxurious, it also has a small spatula to scoop out the cream which I really liked however I would have preferred if there was a place to fit the spatula inside on top of the jar so that its kept safe.The cream smells nice, it has a soft subtle fragrance which reminds me of another cream from my childhood, I wish the fragrance was unique but I don't mind it as its nice.The product absorbs well and doesn't leave my skin greasy which is a plus and it still hydrates very well, I had no dry patches while I was using it and face felt soft to the touch. It also calmed down my breakouts making it the perfect cream for my skin type.Overall the product does what it  claims, nourishes the dry skin and calms it.",4 out of 5 stars.
9681,Avene Revitalising Nourishing Cream 50ml - Moisturiser for Dry sensitive skin,fortune_favours_the_beautiful,"The skin on my face is naturally dry and has been a bit sensitive lately with the changing seasons. Fortunately, I have been given the opportunity to trial the Revitalizing Nourishing Cream from Avene. I have never used anything from this brand before, so I enjoyed not only trialling this but also reading all about the brand in the accompanying information brochure.The jar is pretty big and heavy, it is not something you would necessarily want to take on holiday although at 50ml it does fit within the airline allowances for liquids. There is perhaps too much plastic that goes into the jar and it doesn’t seem to be too environmentally friendly, however the jar is recyclable so that is positive.This face cream is a rich cream, which I prefer applying at night time but which can also be used during the day. It has a cold cream feel to it, and the smell is like fresh laundry or baby powder, which is not my favourite. The smell quickly fades however. The result is an enduring feeling of softness and hydration which lasts for several hours. I have noticed some really positive smoothing effects, and some redness on my face has calmed down since using this cream. My eyes which are very sensitive to fragrances don’t seem to mind this cream at all which is nice and confirms that the brand is committed to providing products for sensitive skin. This is a good face cream that lives up to its hydration claims.",4 out of 5 stars.
9682,Avene Revitalising Nourishing Cream 50ml - Moisturiser for Dry sensitive skin,stefaneigh,"I had never used any Avène products before so I was keen to give this moisturiser a go.  My first impression was the box was a little plain and boring, but the jar inside looked quite classy.  It has a thick edge however so the volume of product is less than you might imagine.  It also comes with a small plastic spatula which can be useful for hygienic application if you use it correctly however I find it is a waste of plastic as it is bother to store and clean fingers are just as good.The moisturiser itself is thick and creamy.  It has a light scent which doesn’t remind me of anything except moisturiser.  It feels very hydrating to apply and while I thought it might be a bit rich, it absorbed reasonably quickly.  I did notice a few tiny breakouts while trying this cream and while I don’t think that is unusual when trying a new skincare product it does normally stop after a few weeks.  Unfortunately, the trial was too short to determine if this happened but I will keep using the cream to find out.    After using this product for a couple of weeks along with the mask twice a week, my skin feels more hydrated to touch but there is no noticeable difference in appearance except for some breakout as mentioned.I was disappointed that the cream does not contain SPF and for that reason alone I would not choose this as my daily morning product.   That fact aside, if the breakouts calm down after my skin adapts to the product, I think it is a lovely hydrating cream.  I would be hesitant to purchase it at the price tag however when I’ve tried many comparable products at lower price points.",4 out of 5 stars.
9683,Avene Revitalising Nourishing Cream 50ml - Moisturiser for Dry sensitive skin,HelenT,"The Avene's revitalising nourishing cream has a lightweight lotion-like texture which feels nice and it just glides on my face effortlessly. The cream has a beautiful but gentle scent which I enjoy and it doesn't cause irritation to my skin.  I apply a decent layer of cream on my face and neck every morning and evening. The cream absorbs into my skin almost instantly and doesn't leave any residue behind or sticks to my pillow when I sleep. When I use it in the morning, the cream keeps my face moisturised throughout the day in an indoor environment. When I use it in evening, I wake up to a smooth well moisturised skin. However, I have dry skin and I feel that this cream is good to use during the warmer months but not hydrating/ moisturising enough during colder/ dryer months. After using this cream for two weeks, I can see my skin stay hydrated.",4 out of 5 stars.
9684,Avene Revitalising Nourishing Cream 50ml - Moisturiser for Dry sensitive skin,Lisa359,"I like Avene products and already use a few so I decided to get this from the rewards room. It comes in a jar that looks bigger than it is due to artful packaging that looks like glass but is actually plastic.  A plastic spatula was also provided. This is marketed towards dry and sensitive skin, maybe my skin is drier than I thought as this did'nt moisturise it enough. I prefer thicker moisturisers and this felt too lightweight. I ended up using this in the mornings and applied a heavier moisturiser at night. This may be more suited towards someone looking for a lightweight moisturiser. I like that it did'nt irritate my sensitive skin and I appreciate the opportunity to try it by redeeming points, but It's not a product I would repurchase.",3 out of 5 stars.
9685,Avene Revitalising Nourishing Cream 50ml - Moisturiser for Dry sensitive skin,Pam D.,"I absolutely love this product, but been very disappointed lately when I open the lid and finding out the product is not flush to the top.

9692,Avene Revitalising Nourishing Cream 50ml - Moisturiser for Dry sensitive skin,darasparkle,"Big thanks again to Beauty Heave and Avene in including me in this trial. I've used a lot of Avene products and always welcome the opportunity to try new ones.The directions are to apply after cleansing and to wear twice a day, so it's a day/nighttime moisturiser.  It also says you can spray the Avene thermal water (which luckily I still have some in my cabinet) after application to soothe and calm any feelings of discomfort. I tried it with and without the spray. I preferred it with a spritz of the spray as I found it settled better.It says it's for Dry to normal skin types. I'm dry/sensitive myself.I followed the directions to a tee and on day 4, I woke up with a bunch of whiteheads on my forehead, which made me very sad. I think the moisturising cream is just overall, too much moisture for me, so I stopped wearing it for 24 hours and then applied my emergency type skincare to calm my skin down. Then I only applied during the daytime and skipped the nighttime step and went back to my regular evening cream. Then after a few days my skin has calmed down.Overall, I wouldn't purchase as I found it made my skin feel shiny/greasy in appearance and feel so it's sadly, not my holy grail moisturiser.",3 out of 5 stars.
9693,Avene Revitalising Nourishing Cream 50ml - Moisturiser for Dry sensitive skin,Emily,"The quality does not reflect the price. It’s very thick, which is nice since I live in the desert, but it takes *forever* to settle into my skin. The fragrance is very 1980s skincare (an artificial, almost plastic scent). I work in a warehouse too, so once I start sweating there is a greasy film on my face from this moisturizer, which clogged up my pores and left a ton of blackheads on my nose.",2 out of 5 stars.

9774,Avene Antirouguers CLEAN Soothing Cleansing Lotion 200ml - Cleanser for Redness-prone skin,Katherine N.,"This is just ok. This line was recommended by my dermatologist. It’s a bit odd to me that it’s called a cleanser yet the directions say to apply to your face and there’s no need to rinse. I just find not rinsing odd if I’m using a product to remove makeup, sunscreen etc. So, because I bought it and it was pricey for me I use it as a second cleanser but gently wipe it away with a cotton ball after I apply it with my fingers. I don’t know that I’d purchase this again. I am noticing less redness but am also using another product from the same Avene line. And because the other product is applied and left on my skin I feel the other product must be more effective. Should have read the instructions better.",3 out of 5 stars.

This serum contains great ingredients to nourish and protect your skin - Vitamin C, Vitamin E, Glycerin and Hyaluronic acid! It feels great on the skin as it does not leave a sticky or tacky residue. Another bonus is that it smells great- no spam scent like others tend to have. I also love how smooth and soft the serum makes my face feel after applying it for a while. When used with other Avene products (i.e. moisturiser, thermal water mist, cleanser), it makes my skin glow a little more. There’s nothing I can fault about this serum. It’s one of my favourite products and highly recommend it to anyone looking for a great Vitamin C serum.",5 out of 5 stars.

It also has hyaluronic acid and Vitamin E which gives additional hydration to a dull, dehydrated skin or those needed extra moisture.I love the pump action container as you can determine how much you need or use without wasting it - important as it can expensive for many users. I also love that my skin feels soft after using it and doesn't irritate my skin as it can sometimes react to products.

Within a week my skin was noticeably brighter and my skin tone was evened out and the dullness was gone. I always look tired due to lack of sleep and shift work etc and this works wonders.

I like it so much I got her to get me one too. I’m a guy so I’m not really big on skincare but this is something that I now use everyday.. It smells nice and the smell is not too strong.

My skin is quite dry and I have sensitivities to some products.I found this serum very easy to pump out the amount I want with a little bit going a long way. On applying to skin it absorbed quickly and was the perfect base for moisturiser and make up. The scent is noticeable but I didn't find it too strong or overpowering. After using it for around 2 weeks I can feel my skin feels smoother and softer whilst looking brighter as well.

But after using this serum, I can definitely say I'm going to start looking into trying more of their products because I loved this product. I've used this product only for a few weeks but my skin was noticeably smoother, more hydrated and brighter within a week of using. The product itself is very light and sinks into the skin very nicely. There is however a scent to it, it's not too overpoweringly strong but it's definitely not light either. If you prefer unscented products, I don't think this will be a good product to try. Besides that, I loved the product and will definitely repurchase once this runs out",5 out of 5 stars.

9809,Avene A-Oxitive SERUM Antioxidant Defence Serum 30ml - Vitamin C Serum for Sensitive skin,Nancy N.,"[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I have been on the hunt for a Vitamin C serum that works for me so I was excited to try this serum and I really, really like it!The serum is easy to use and is a great addition to my skin care routine. It’s gentle enough to use daily and I have noticed a difference in the appearance of my skin – The texture of my skin is a lot smoother, my skin is visibly brighter and my skin tone has evened out. I haven’t been using product long enough to notice a reduction in fine lines but I am really happy with the results I am seeing thus far.I’ve tried a lot of other Vitamin C serums that dry out my skin, but this serum makes my skin feel hydrated and plump which I love. My skin type is normal/combo so I wasn’t sure if the gentle formula would be effective, but I have been pleasantly surprised. The texture of the serum is light and refreshing and sinks into the skin beautifully. It is not tacky like some other serums can be. I really like the scent of the serum but it might not be everyone’s cup of tea.On another note, I appreciate that the pump on the bottle can be locked which makes it perfect for travelling. This serum would be perfect for anyone looking to incorporate a gentle and hydrating Vitamin C into their daily routine that actually works.",5 out of 5 stars.
9810,Avene A-Oxitive SERUM Antioxidant Defence Serum 30ml - Vitamin C Serum for Sensitive skin,Eleanor H.,"[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] This serum is fantastic! I have been trialling it for 3 weeks and have noticed visible improvements in the texture, brightness and hydration of my skin. It doesn't have a distinct smell and is smooth to apply. I found it fine to layer under moisturiser, spf and makeup. I have been using vitamin C everyday for a few years but at a much higher price point. After this trial, I would happily swap to this cheaper alternative as I believe it generates just as effective results.",5 out of 5 stars.

I’d tried a few other dark spot removal creams in the past with no change; this product has changed them in just a few weeks. It is very light so absorbs rapidly, with no residue. It is quite hydrating. It is a bit too heavy on the perfume for my liking, but the scent is pleasant and doesn’t linger.",5 out of 5 stars.

I truly appreciate the non-irritating, almost soothing, formula of this. Since I started using this serum I have seen improvement to my skin texture and overall tone, as well as some post acne marks. Overall I'm very glad I tried this and would recommend it to anyone on the hunt for a vitamin c serum.",5 out of 5 stars.

9814,Avene A-Oxitive SERUM Antioxidant Defence Serum 30ml - Vitamin C Serum for Sensitive skin,Fatemeh E.,"[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I have to start of by saying that I am genuinely impressed by this serum. I have been using this serum for almost two weeks and I have seen results. I have tried many other skin care products more and less expensive than this, and this is probably one of the very few things that I have seen results with. I have a very tired looking complexion from lack of sleep and being a shift worker. I also have acne prone skin and some pigmentation left over by old pimples. After 5-7 days I noticed that my skin looked brighter and my skin tone was more even. The texture is light and easily absorbed and did not irritate my skin at all. No strong scent either! I only use it once a day and some days twice a day. Imagine if I used it twice a day - I think I would have seen results faster. Yes it is a little pricey but I think it’s well worth the investment and a bottle can last a couple of months easily. Will definetly be repurchasing! If you’re looking at trying serums - I would say this is a good place to start.",5 out of 5 stars.

But WOW, this product is honestly the best thing since sliced bread.The best thing is the hydration. Within 24 hours of first using this product, my skin was super soft (which is saying something as I have very dry skin). I'm not sure I can notice any difference in brightness yet but I see antioxidants as more of a protective ingredient anyway.Also, the texture of this product is beautiful. Not greasy or gritty, like many other Vitamin C products are.",5 out of 5 stars.
9817,Avene A-Oxitive SERUM Antioxidant Defence Serum 30ml - Vitamin C Serum for Sensitive skin,Isabella T.,[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] YES!

My skin tone is a lot more even now too! Highly Recommend,5 out of 5 stars.
9818,Avene A-Oxitive SERUM Antioxidant Defence Serum 30ml - Vitamin C Serum for Sensitive skin,Bridget L.,"[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] The Avene A-oxidative serum is very gentle on the skin and doesn’t leave an oily or greasy residue afterwards like most other serums I have tried. I was pleasantly surprised with the texture of the serum as it is more of a light moisturiser rather than an oil. It’s light on the skin as it absorbs quickly, yet leaves your skin feeling very moisturised and glowy. There’s a slight fragrance to it that’s light and refreshing and definitely not overpowering, perfect for sensitive skin. I’ve added the Avene A-oxitive serum to my daily cleansing routine and after a week or two, have already noticed amazing differences to my skin. My skin feels smoother, more hydrated and softer. I’ve also noticed that my skin appears brighter, with a couple dark spots (acne scarring) beginning to fade. I would definitely recommend this product to everyone, especially those who have sensitive skin!",5 out of 5 stars.

9843,Avene A-Oxitive SERUM Antioxidant Defence Serum 30ml - Vitamin C Serum for Sensitive skin,Tarraise,I've loved trialling the serum over the last 2 weeks.The serum  is not quite the texture I was expecting.When I think serum I think of an oil type texture. This one is more of a light cream.It smells quite nice. I'm not sure if it's scented but it smells like a gentle moisturiser type smell. My skin can be quite temperamental during the change of season and cold weather. I also have issues with mild acne and rosacea.When washing my face I started with my usual cleanser and toner. I then followed this with the serum and then a moisturiser. I used both morning and night.I have no adverse reaction and it didn't make my acne or rosacea any worse. If anything the cooling effect of the serum helped ease my rosacea slightly.It feels nice when applying it. It's light and spreads out nice and smooth. It absorbs easily leaving e skin feeling love.y and soft with zero residue. After the serum is applied the scent pretty much disappears.I would definitely recommend it to friends and family. I think it would be especially good for those with sensitive as it's designed for sensitive skin!,5 out of 5 stars.

The Equivalent to 15% Pure vitamin C is stated on the box.Easy to use pump action, a little certainly goes a long way.  This has a lovely fragrance (almost like I'm in a high end salon).I do recommend this serum, it is one of the best I have used in a long time. The serum leaves a little shimmer which I really enjoy.  It is very light white fluid that I apply and any residual I always apply to the back of my hands.  This has proven fruitful over the years as my hands have no age spots on them. Always remember to apply all residual products to the back of your hands.Thank you Beauty Heaven for this beautiful ""win"" I will be using this until its last drop.4*",4 out of 5 stars.

It was very easy to slip into my routine and I loved that as well as the vitamin c, it also contained vitamin e and hydrators - I certainly felt like my skin was plump and juicy after using this!I haven't been using it long enough to notice any reduction in fine lines, but I really enjoy this as a one-and-done morning serum.

A little goes a long way, which is something that I appreciate in my skin care products. The two difficulties I had with the products were that:1) It has a very strong smell, which is a quality that I do enjoy in my skin care products. 2) I have been advised against using vitamin c serums whilst also using exfoliating acids. As I incorporate exfoliating acids into my skin care routine regularly, this affects how frequently I would be able to use this Avene serum.

9897,Avene A-Oxitive SERUM Antioxidant Defence Serum 30ml - Vitamin C Serum for Sensitive skin,Anonymous,I still do not understand why Avene's products are so highly fragranced. It's so off-putting even when I don't have sensitive skin and I actually don't mind a bit of fragrance but Avene's seen to be so potent. I couldn't continue using this serum which I won from bh last year in an Avene pack. I had to throw it away because of the fragrance. The serum leaves my skin tacky and I didn't notice that it brightened my skin or made any noticeable changes so I ended up discontinuing using it because of the smell.,1 out of 5 stars.
9898,Avene SPF 50+ Sunscreen Spray 200ml,Sofia E.,"Firstly I wanted to say I love the pull off tab you need to remove before you can take off the plastic cap. The 200mL bottle is very easy to hold and very appealing on the eye being bright orange with black and white printing. The press down nozzle for the spray is nice and big wide enough to fit my thumb. Once pressed it sprays out a decent amount of the sunscreen white in color great to see where the product is on the skin and doesn’t spray out too much at a time which I love because it gives me time to rub it in properly before spraying again. It doesn’t take long to rub in or absorb at all very quickly actually and it dries matte but feels moisturised which for me is very important as I cannot stand that really greasy sunscreen feeling. The scent is nice think sunscreen/skincare and very lovely light scent. Love that this is an all in one face and body spray and has a very high protection of uvb and uva rays.

9900,Avene SPF 50+ Sunscreen Spray 200ml,Steph L.,"[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Of the three new Avene sunscreens I tried, this was definitely my favorite. I loved the convenience of the spray nozzle for both face and body. It also seems to have a lot lighter feeling to it than the other two creams do. The formula isn’t too runny or greasy and gives you high protection from the sun. It didn’t  irritate my sensitive skin at all either which was great. Being quite pale, this worked well for me in terms of actual sun protection and not appearing too “white” on the skin. It gives a nice glow and great coverage when rubbed in properly. I also swam after using this  and it still stayed on the body for quite a while longer. Definitely recommend!",5 out of 5 stars.
9901,Avene SPF 50+ Sunscreen Spray 200ml,Nicole D.,"[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I recently used this whilst on holiday and found it to be the perfect addition to my beach bag. What I love is that it is so easy to apply, mess free and aerosol free. The spray bottle is leak proof, and easy to be used by the whole family. It makes application easy and mess free, despite wind or sand.The formulation is great and I found it to provide adequate protection throughout the day.",5 out of 5 stars.
9902,Avene SPF 50+ Sunscreen Spray 200ml,Natasha p.,"[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I really enjoyed this spray SPF! The SPF rating is quite good for the Aussie sun, the smell is pleasant and protected my sensitive skin. It does need to be sprayed and then rubbed in so be mindful of clothing when spraying. Really easy to spray on on your way out the door!",5 out of 5 stars.
9903,Avene SPF 50+ Sunscreen Spray 200ml,Jacqueline H.,"[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I really like this sunscreen. It soaks in easily and immediately to leave less of a white cast than the face and body lotion. It left a nice finish on my skin – not too greasy or too dry, and adds a subtle healthy shine. It wore well throughout the day and was easy to reapply. The spray nozzle is a bit unpredictable but I got around this when needed by first spraying it into my hand and then applying to my body. Wearing this sunscreen according to instructions, I noticed no colour or burn after exposure to the sun.",5 out of 5 stars.
9904,Avene SPF 50+ Sunscreen Spray 200ml,Paula S.,[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] This is perfect for the beach or pool. Great application and perfect and easy for the whole family to use. Goes a long way.three trips to the beach for 6 of us and only a third through the bottle!

9905,Avene SPF 50+ Sunscreen Spray 200ml,Abbey R.,"[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] The spray application on this product is fantastic! It's not messy or runny, instead it sprays the perfect amount of sunscreen onto the skin. I love the formula, not too thick and not too runny. Your skin doesn't feel heavy or greasy after application. This is the only sunscreen I've used for myself and my kids since I first tried it. I'll definitely purchase this product when we eventually run out.",5 out of 5 stars.
9906,Avene SPF 50+ Sunscreen Spray 200ml,Taylor R.,[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] This is my favourite sunscreen ! It’s lightweight and so convenient in a spray bottle. Seems thin but it works so well. Only a short span of protection when swimming but it’s so lightweight and doesn’t feel sticky or irritate my skin so I’d much prefer to reapply regularly over the “long lasting” heavy creams. Will be repurchasing for sure!,5 out of 5 stars.
9907,Avene SPF 50+ Sunscreen Spray 200ml,JULIE P.,[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] The spray is easy to use and gives a light amount onto the skin. It is perfect for myself and my family who have sensitive and ezcema skin. I love that it is light and I can just chuck into the beach bag for summer days at the pool and beach! The orange bottle stands out when looking in the bag trying to find things. I love that you can see where you have sprayed onto the skin and it absorbs nicely into the skin. It is water resistant and has a high spf factor. I shared this with a mutual friend who thought this was a lovely sunscreen to use as well.,5 out of 5 stars.
9908,Avene SPF 50+ Sunscreen Spray 200ml,Linda K.,"[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] This is one of the pricier sunscreens I've seen on the market. However, it does provide high protection and does not irritate my skin. Out of the three avene sunscreens, I've tried, I must say this is my favourite one. It is easy to use, apply on the skin and skins into the skin quite well. As it is a spray, it is lighter than normal sunscreens and dries pretty quick",5 out of 5 stars.

9910,Avene SPF 50+ Sunscreen Spray 200ml,Fleur S.,"[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I really love this spray version of the body Avene sunscreen, as it is great to take on a picnic or the beach, as the container doesn’t leak and it is really easy to use. I love the feel of a spray sunscreen as it feels so light on my skin and is really easy to rub right in with no greasy feel afterwards, meaning you can dress straight after applying. The feel and smell of this sunscreen is just beautiful and after trying this, I don’t know if I can go back to the brands I have used previously!I would like to check that it really does have a good SPF, as some brands have been caught out in the past,  but I will definitely continue to use this sunscreen.",5 out of 5 stars.
9911,Avene SPF 50+ Sunscreen Spray 200ml,Aoife R.,[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I loved this sunscreen! It is very reasonably priced but the packaging feels luxurious. The sunscreen is a high rating SPF and does not leave a white cast. I especially liked that the product was not greasy at all and dried in straight away. I used this product every day and will repurchase.,5 out of 5 stars.
9912,Avene SPF 50+ Sunscreen Spray 200ml,Natasha t.,"[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Love this! Use it on my body daily now.  I love the fact it is a spray and it is easy to apply and not a bad residue on hands and doesn't feel oily.  No irrigation on my sensitive skin and when i go for my daily walks i am not coming home pink, great protection.",5 out of 5 stars.
9913,Avene SPF 50+ Sunscreen Spray 200ml,Cheryl  T.,This sunscreen is light yet high in spf and no usual sunscreen smell you get from generic brands. Its reasonably priced.   I applied it to go for walks in summer and I hadn't got burnt. I even use it for my 4 and 9yr old. Suitable for all ages hassle free just 1 bottle for the whole family instead of lugging around different bottles of sunscreen. Definitely recommend it,5 out of 5 stars.

9915,Avene SPF 50+ Sunscreen Spray 200ml,tng78,Another fantastic product from Avene. This spray on sunscreen offers great protection from the harsh australian sun.

9918,Avene SPF 50+ Sunscreen Spray 200ml,SJH24,"I was hoping it would be a light mist for the face, but it’s more the type of thing you need to pump onto your hands and then apply. It leaves no sting to the eyes and the white cast subsides fairly quickly. Effective at preventing sunburn. I use this as my top up throughout the day.",4 out of 5 stars.
9919,Avene SPF 50+ Sunscreen Spray 200ml,Darcy L.,"[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I have really enjoyed this product, and I think it performs really well as a broad spectrum sunscreen, most suitable for days when you are getting a bit of sun but not too much - it's certainly not something I would take to the beach on a summer day, for example.  It's not overly thick or greasy, which is nice, and has a relatively inoffensive smell. I usually only purchase sunscreens made by Australian brands (makes me feel like they understand what our sun is like!) but this product certainly performs just as well. Beware, however, that I will need to be reapplied if you are sweating/swimming, as it has little in the way of water resistance. Also enjoy the spray function as it makes it easier to apply.",4 out of 5 stars.
9920,Avene SPF 50+ Sunscreen Spray 200ml,Emily L.,"[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I love Avene skincare so was excited to try their sunscreen range in the lead up to summer. I wear sunscreen daily and have sensitive skin and this product fitted seamlessly into my routine. The bottle size is large enough to feel you are getting value for money and the lightweight formulation didn't irritate my skin in anyway. I like the spray bottle functionality as it makes it easier to spread across arms, legs and body. The product is lightly scented however this could have been a more pleasant smell, I didn't love it. The output of the spray is not as spread out as I might like either... meaning it could potentially be a more efficient spray. Overall a great product that I will continue to use throughout summer.",4 out of 5 stars.
9921,Avene SPF 50+ Sunscreen Spray 200ml,Pri S.,"[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] This comes in a bright orange 200mL spray bottle that, with its brightness, is easy to find in my straw handbag and spritz on at the beach. The sunscreen offers 40 minutes of water resistant protection with a UV protection of 50+. The sunscreen is lightweight with a mild scent. It applies easily and coats my skin, protecting it from the harmful rays at the beach. Whether I'm swimming in the water or just sweating in the heat, I can relax knowing I have sun protection on.",4 out of 5 stars.
9922,Avene SPF 50+ Sunscreen Spray 200ml,Yuliya C.,"[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I liked the lightweight formula of this and the convenience of spray application. Despite that, I kept feeling paranoid that I wasn't using enough. I didn't get any new freckles so the protection must be good. It feels great on the skin and soaks in almost instantly. It smells quite nice compared to other sunscreens and doesn't irritate my skin. Would recommend!",4 out of 5 stars.
9923,Avene SPF 50+ Sunscreen Spray 200ml,Meg C.,[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Avène Sunscreen Spray SPF 50+ is a convenient packaged spray sunscreen with high UV protection. I found this sunscreen to be good for the body but slightly sticky on the face. It is great for a quick spray that doesn't require too much rubbing in. It feels lighter on the skin however it is on the expensive side for sunscreen.,4 out of 5 stars.
9924,Avene SPF 50+ Sunscreen Spray 200ml,Laura S.,"[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Nice thick formula, good coverage but a little difficult to spread. Not oily and doesn't leave a filmy/sticky on the skin. Wouldn't recommend for a pool or beach day as the suncream isn't very waterproof, only 40 minutes.",4 out of 5 stars.
9925,Avene SPF 50+ Sunscreen Spray 200ml,Natalie S.,"[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I received this product as a trial, and would definitely recommend it to others.I found the spray nozzle made the sunscreen so easy to apply at the beach, and as the consistency of the sunscreen was very thin, it applied onto the skin so easily and effortlessly.As with the other products in the range, I think this is a really good product, but I'm not really a fan of the subtle scent. Overall however I would recommend this sunscreen to others and would purchase it again myself.",4 out of 5 stars.

9928,Avene SPF 50+ Sunscreen Spray 200ml,Alicia D.,I'm not really a fan of this sunscreen because of the very visible white case it leaves on my skin. When I apply this to my face it fills my lines and makes them look white causing me to keep checking myself in a mirror and continually trying to blend the white cast away. It's also quite greasy. With this sunscreen you need to spray it into your hand first before applying as the mist isn't as fine as I would expect it to be. It comes out quite heavy. The liquid is also very watery and has a fragrance which didn't irritate my combination skin at all. I did find that this protects my skin from the sun but because of the white cast and greasiness I wouldn't use this again once this bottle is empty.,2 out of 5 stars.
9929,Avene SPF 50+ Sunscreen Spray 200ml,Gracey 91,I don’t know why chemist warehouse put  short expiration period sunscreen on shelves. I just bought this week and just seen it will expired in 09/21 as I spend 21$ on it only lasts for 2months very disappointing.,2 out of 5 stars.

9943,Avene Tolerance CONTROL Soothing Skin Recovery Balm 40ml - Moisturiser for hypersensitive and dry skin,Ashley R.,"This is almost a direct copy/paste of my cleanser review, but it applies to this balm, too. My skin is extremely reactive lately. I am acne-prone and my dermatologist has me on a benzoyl peroxide/clindamycin topical in the morning and a tretinoin topical at night. This combination (particularly in the mornings) can cause a lot of stinging, burning, itching, and discomfort after cleansing and applying the topical, and that's before I apply my moisturizer. Moisturizers have traditionally amplified these sensations and it can be so bad that I will avoid my routine for a few days, which exacerbates my acne. I have to use moisturizer due to the drying nature of the medications, and I absolutely must use sunscreen, which is also extremely painful. The problem has been that all of this HURTS! I've only used this moisturizer twice so far, once last night after my tretinoin (usually the time I have no issues, even with other gentle moisturizers), and once this morning following my bzp/clin topical. So far, I am IN LOVE! The morning application didn't burn and make me want to rip my skin off. I'm also using the tolerance extremely gentle cleanser and the combination is lovely. It doesn't burn, itch, sting, or hurt. My face feels moisturized and comfortable, soft, and it doesn't appear overly flaky. I am so thrilled I found this skincare line by total accident. I love my Cetaphil, but even that hasn't cut it with these topical medications. Maybe now I'll actually keep up on the daily routine with my topicals since I don't have to choose between painful, clearer skin and a face riddled with breakouts.",5 out of 5 stars.

10095,Avene Tolerance CONTROL Soothing Skin Recovery Balm 40ml - Moisturiser for hypersensitive and dry skin,Carolin,"I have been using both the Avene Tolerance Extreme Cream and the Skin Recovery Cream for many years. However, in the last two years, I started to notice that my skin didn't tolerate both of them anymore and would always look irritated and never moisturized whenever I would apply them. I also never liked the textures - they never worked well with other products and under makeup. So I welcome the much-needed update on this product! It feels smooth on the skin, does not irritate so far, soaks in completely, and does not peel off my skin. The new packaging is also much better (the old one always made me pump out too much product). Two things I don't like though are, first, that the tube contains now only 40ml instead of 50ml, and second, that the names are confusing. I didn't realize that there was a balm and cream version in-store and also didn't get that this is the updated version of the skin recovery cream and not the updated tolerance extreme cream.",5 out of 5 stars.

This is a small tube with a somewhat pesky dispensing pump & I can see having to re-order this every two or three weeks but no worries, I am just happy Avene is offering this miracle balm. It absorbs quickly, is never sticky or tacky, never pills-up, and leaves a glowing matte finish. After 12 hours or more of application I still feel hydrated. I'm glad it is made just for the face for my legs & my face are two very different ecosystems! Thank you Avene!",5 out of 5 stars.

Maybe it is in the translation from French to English - like 'balm' has a different meaning there? I do love this as a moisturizer but I wouldn't call it a balm and I don't think it is helping with my skin barrier. I appreciate that there is no added fragrance, I love the packaging too.

10109,Avene Tolerance CONTROL Soothing Skin Recovery Balm 40ml - Moisturiser for hypersensitive and dry skin,SkincareObsessed,"When I read it as a balm, I was unsure how it would work for my combination dry skin, quite temperamental really. Using this on dry or irritated patches helped soothe and heal my skin. Plus buffering with this on nights I use retinol, really brings out the best of the skincare routine. Also it isn’t a balm with butter and oils as such, it’s more thick cream but absorbs nicely.",4 out of 5 stars.
10110,Avene Tolerance CONTROL Soothing Skin Recovery Balm 40ml - Moisturiser for hypersensitive and dry skin,VanessaG8,"I usually prefer a gel moisturiser for a lightweight feel but this sounded ideal for me. It absorbs fairly well considering how thick it is, and my skin doesn't seem upset about it which is a great sign as I find I often upset the balance when trying new products. It seems like it's going to be greasy but it's all hydration and goodness. I've decided I still prefer a gel moisturiser for day wear and under any makeup product but this has been lovely for evening. Happy!",4 out of 5 stars.

I was devastated to find it was discontinued, but was told to try Tolerance Control Skin Recovery Cream in its place. I was hoping it would be the same product with a different name. I tried that and it did not make my skin feel plump and full, like the Extreme Cream used to. I hoped that the Tolerance Control Skin Recovery Balm would be a substitute, so I tried that next. This balm is extremely waxy and greasy. As soon as I applied it, I felt the need to wash my face. I only return things that I know I will never use or recommend. I returned this.",1 out of 5 stars.

It’s very very mild, yet soothing when there is skin irritation. For example, I had poison ivy and the gel did not burn at all. It calmed the area. I don’t use it on my face, have another cleanser for that, although it’s probably fine. I notice the gel does not completely remove zinc oxide sunscreen, which perhaps is a good thing? I wish my son would use it on my 6 mo. grandson who has eczema.",5 out of 5 stars.

10223,Avene TriXera Nutrition Nutri-fluid Cleanser 400ml - Cleanser for Dry skin,Linda X.,"This cleanser does the job but leaves me a little dry, so this is not really suitable for dry skin as marketed and certainly does not replenish lipids. Let's talk about the elephant in the room though: the fragrance. It is really nauseating and strong. I am very surprised by the other reviews which have stated that there is not a strong scent or that the scent is light. Fragrance is in the mid-range level in the ingredients list and it is obvious there is a lot of it in the mix. This is also why I find it incredulous that this is marketed as suiting sensitive skin types as well, seeing as fragrance is a known skin irritant. The fragrance is an absolute deterrent for me. This is marketed as suitable for use on the face and body. Perhaps this is better used on the body because I find it completely unsuitable for the face and particularly a dry and sensitive one. I have typically enjoyed Avene products and the remainder of the TriXera range, but this product is a negative outlier.",2 out of 5 stars.

10248,Avene Trixera Nutrition Nutri-fluid Balm 400ml,belle_SA,The Trixera Balm has a really interesting texture - it is rich and nourishing but with the silky texture of a lotion. It feels light on the skin and sinks in quickly but provides good hydration. It is fragrance free and perfect for really sensitive skin like mine. As it is unscented there is a slight smell from the ingredients in the product - to me it smells like Greek yoghurt which I don’t mind - but this disappears immediately after application. A great choice for sensitive skin.,5 out of 5 stars.

10252,Avene Trixera Nutrition Nutri-fluid Balm 400ml,Beauty Aisle Regular,"I have been using this moisturiser for about 1-2 weeks now and am extremely happy with the results.  My skin tends to dry out quite easily but this product has been successfully dealing with this issue.  I apply this moisturiser all over each night and my skin stays soft, smooth and supple.  The fact that it is fragrance free is definitely a big draw card as I also have slightly sensitive skin and fragrance is always an issue.  Although it is called a balm (and provides a high concentration of moisture) it actually has the consistency of a milk.  This means that it spreads very well and a little goes a long way.  Considering it comes in a 400ml bottle, at a very reasonable price, I think this product is highly cost effective.  I already use other Avene products and  am very happy with my new purchase.",5 out of 5 stars.

Found this to be a thin moisturiser but absorbing, leaving the skin feeling hydrated and non greasy. Brilliant under foundation as it leaves a matt effect. I struggle with red blotches on the tops of my cheeks which this moisturiser has reduced. The red blotches are obviously more noticeable when I’m not wearing makeup, which is a regular occurrence these days as home or when out, using a mask. This is a kind, none stinging moisturiser and only a small amount is required to cover the face.",5 out of 5 stars.

Great product.",4 out of 5 stars.

10406,Avene Cleanance Mattifying Emulsion 40ml - Moisturiser for Oily skin,Msfoxymax,"[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I’ve been using this for a few weeks now and so far i am fairly impressed. It doesn’t smell strong, simple to apply and spread over skin and leaves skin feeling smooth. It works so well on my oilier areas such as t zone and chin but made a little dry patch on my nose/cheek look more obvious. I started using a little serum in my dry area just before applying this emulsion and it made a huge difference. Any little niggly spots that were trying to appear seemed to either gonaway faster or just not fully appear. All in all it’s a great product for anyone with normal to oily skin but for dry or combination you might prefer to assist your dry areas with another serum or moisturiser if you decide to use this in your skincare routine. It’s a lovely product though and probably would use it again. Looking forward to seeing how it copes in my oily areas when the weather gets warmer and how to copes with my shiny areas then.",4 out of 5 stars.

It’s not too heavy or drying for my face and smells so clean.

10412,Avene Cleanance Mattifying Emulsion 40ml - Moisturiser for Oily skin,nsl75,[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Handy size tube which fits into your handbag if needed. One small pea size amount is enough to cover face and neck area.The fragrance was a little off putting for me as it seemed a mixture of floral and faintly chemically . This is a minor issue but if you are very sensitive to fragrance this may be a bit strong for you .I would have given higher star rating if not for the fragrance . It makes your skin feel super smooth and takes away the feel of oiliness from areas which suffer from this . It blends into your skin quickly without any sticky residue and feels lightweight and fresh in your skin. I’d recommend this for how soft it makes your skin feel alone .,3 out of 5 stars.

I always like like I was sweating so not a good look I've tried many creams and foundations to try to control the problem but nothing worked well enough! That is until I tried Avène Mattifying Emulsion!Ive been using for a few weeks as I wanted to test it in different environments and during different daily activities.I apply it to my oily prone areas first and then just rubbed what was left on my hands all over my face to have a completely balanced coverage, may I say a little goes a long way and blends in beautifully and so light, I have sensitive skin so am always hesitant to try new products but I needn't be worried because it caused no irritation at all and blended in easily, having left for a few mins I carry on applying my usual foundation and daily make up.By mid day I checked and I was pleasently surprised I didn't need to do any touch ups as my skin was still looking just as it did when I applied it, not even a shine was visible! It actually stayed oil free all day with no touch ups, I'm so impressed! It's now day 16 and I've tried and tested it through excersise, brisk walking, cycling, chilling In the garden on warm days, shopping, working etc and it's passed with flying colours Im never going back! 100% recommended!",2 out of 5 stars.

However this product was sadly discontinued. So, I went back to this cream. I was shocked at how different the formula is now. It contains dimethicone which I think is the reason it now has a greasy feel and no longer absorbs into the skin. Hours after I applied it my face was covered in a greasy shiny coating that I had to wash off because it was so unpleasant. This formula just sits on the skin. I returned it and am searching for a replacement. Very disappointing.",1 out of 5 stars.

10535,Avene Thermal Spring Water 150ml - Mist for Sensitive skin,Audra,"I was skeptical. It is water. It is not a laser. It is not a high priced cream formulated by a trendy dermatologist. What is water going to do? Golly, was I proven wrong! I have much sun damage from being a child growing up in the late 70s and early 80s in California. Sunscreen? What's that? ""Pass the Ban De Soliel for the Sun"" as the commercials went. In the late 80s and early 90s I was a swimmer. I discovered sunscreen, but then became a distance swimmer. You can't exactly stop and reapply sunscreen in the middle of an ocean swim or you get disqualified if you touch the boat. I was young and stupid and about sun protection. I have a lot of sun damage from being young and stupid. Now as a cancer survivor I have a few large slit scars from surgery. The one on my neck from my thyroidectomy REALLY bothers me. This water is healing my skin!!! Again, it is just the thermal mineral and prebiotic water. It is miraculous! My skepticism was proven out the window! It is healing my sun damage. It is lessening the appearance of and softening my surgical scars. It is a God send for eczema flares and otherwise irritated or angry skin. How did I make it into my mid forties never hearing or this product or using it before? If you were skeptical like me, give it a go. You'll never be more pleased you were proven wrong. This is not only a ""game changer"" as some over say it is a watery miracle. Now I believe the people who go to the destinations for the healing waters. I'm saving up for trip to the Avene spa myself. It is safe for we of the supersensitive skin. It is safe for we cancer patients. Check with your doctor before hand/I am not a doctor nor doling out medical advice but I would spray this on a radiation burn zebra stripe without hesitating. Same with a sun burn. It is the ONLY thing now I used during an eczema flare up or summer mosquito bite. To summarize: I'm a former skeptic now preaching this product.",5 out of 5 stars.

My current skin is midway through second pregnancy - which means a mixture of break outs and dry patches which really hurt.  I found the spring water to be the perfect product to put on my skin post washing my face, it was instantly cooling and hydrating.

10831,Avene Thermal Spring Water 150ml - Mist for Sensitive skin,Megan G.,[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I was surprised at how quickly this product helped ease my skin irritation following a flare up of eczema and contact dermatitis on both my face and my body.

10832,Avene Thermal Spring Water 150ml - Mist for Sensitive skin,Jess U.,"[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] The Avène Thermal Spring Water is a mist that provides soothing, softening benefits for sensitive, hypersensitive and allergic skin. Like most people, I was pretty sceptical about this and thought it was simply expensive water in can. The nozzle and pressure of the can provides a good volume of mist and coverage, and is easy to use on the face or all over the body. The thermal spring water has been refreshing and soothing, especially on days when my skin is dry, red or irritated. I have noticed that after using the spray, it provides a nice soothing feeling, calms down the redness and irritation on the skin, and a nice hydration boost before moisturising to lock that moisture. It is really easy to use, simply point the nozzle and spray, giving a bit of time and pat down to dry. This product is multipurpose and great to leave in the fridge for a cool refreshing spritz especially on a hot day or to help sooth any irritation or redness. Though it is pretty expensive to simply use as a cooling mist. I do like the soothing effects, minimising irritation and redness, as well as the hydration boost before moisturising.",5 out of 5 stars.
10833,Avene Thermal Spring Water 150ml - Mist for Sensitive skin,Linda K.,"[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Before testing this product out, I was kept sceptical. However, as someone who suffers from dry skin and eczema, I was pleasantly surprised with the results this spring water provided. It's almost an all-purpose skin spray; I used it before applying makeup and also on my dry skin. It's added hydration to my skin and is very soothing I would also say I was surprised by how big the 300mL was. I would, however, repurchase the smaller bottle just to keep in my handbag to refresh my face.",5 out of 5 stars.

10836,Avene Thermal Spring Water 150ml - Mist for Sensitive skin,Ping C.,[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] This spray was really easy and refreshing to use. The spring water comes out as a fine mist which was very cooling especially on hot days.I normally do suffer from dry skin and I felt that it did help to put the moisture back especially in the dry areas of my face.The 300mL bottle was a bit big to carry around but I do know it does come in the smaller sizes which would be handy to pop into my handbag.Overall I would recommend this product to everyone especially coming into the summer months where this would be a nice refreshing spray,5 out of 5 stars.

Also, it has relived and lessened the visibility of skin irritation too. Now I've added it to my daily skin routine and have never looked back. Highly recommend this product.",5 out of 5 stars.
10840,Avene Thermal Spring Water 150ml - Mist for Sensitive skin,Lucy N.,[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I have been curious about Avène Thermal Spring Water for a while now but was skeptical of it's claims as it seemed like just water in a can. So I was pleasantly surprised by how it calmed down my dry patches and eczema. The mist is very fine and adds a luxurious boost of hydration to the skin. It it light and refreshing enough that it doesn't feel like it is weighing down my skin as the weather warms up.,5 out of 5 stars.
10841,Avene Thermal Spring Water 150ml - Mist for Sensitive skin,Erica D.,"[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Coming into summer I am so excited to use this. I have incorporated it into my every day routine from morning to night - it's great to spray over your face to wake up in the morning before applying serums and moisturisers, can be used throughout the day to refresh dull, dry looking make up without it shifting or sliding off, and before bed for a lasting hit of hydration before applying heavier creams.I also kept this in the fridge and used it on almost sunburnt skin and found it so hydrating and non sticky (unlike moisturisers/aloe gel).",5 out of 5 stars.
10842,Avene Thermal Spring Water 150ml - Mist for Sensitive skin,Joyce C.,"[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] The effects of this spray has really surprised me – it’s so soothing and refreshing, and really helps hydrate my otherwise dry and sensitive face.

I highly recommend this product to anyone with sensitive skin like mine, that could use a hydration boost and refreshing pick me up.",5 out of 5 stars.
10843,Avene Thermal Spring Water 150ml - Mist for Sensitive skin,Helen D.,"[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I love this refreshing spray! I guess it's hard to write a review and the number one thing that people wonder is &quot;do I need this?&quot; And if you're even considering buying this, I'm going to say yes and here's why...It's so versatile and refreshing!!!! There are just so many uses and I particularly loved the tip of popping it in the fridge for a cold mist. I must say, I particularly loved it after a beach visit to freshen up and prevent my face going crusty or salty from the beach! I love it as a base/first step for skincare as I find products get absorbed better when there is a little premoisture/hydration. I love it to refresh my makeup-spray a little at the end of the day and you feel fresher. Dab away any extra moisture and oil and you'll look as good as new! Whilst this product isn't an &quot;essential&quot; like say, an SPF or moisturiser, I think it is an essential in that once you have it you'll wonder how you did without it.",5 out of 5 stars.
10844,Avene Thermal Spring Water 150ml - Mist for Sensitive skin,Julia N.,[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] SUCH a refreshing product.

10845,Avene Thermal Spring Water 150ml - Mist for Sensitive skin,Talia C.,"[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] This water spray really surprised me! It was super hydrating and calming. I love to use this morning and night after cleansing for a smooth hydrated base before I apply my other skincare products. My sensitive skin had a reaction to another product, and after spraying this I definitely saw a visible improvement in the irritation and the redness completely went away. The spray is so refreshing, I love having this bottle on my bedside table to really wake me up in the morning or spray during the night to cool down. I can already tell this is going to be a staple for me in summer. Although the bottle is quite large, it’s easy to hold and use and you get a lot of product! The mist feels amazing and distributes the product perfectly across the face. This is definitely a product for people who want to treat themselves and add a luxurious extra step to their skincare routine!",5 out of 5 stars.

10847,Avene Thermal Spring Water 150ml - Mist for Sensitive skin,Tahlee A.,[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] This product does exactly what it sets out to do- hydrate and revitalise. Whilst trying out this product I tried it in a variety of ways:1. I have quite dry skin especially on my legs and in particular my shins. Applying this added moisture back and especially after going to the beach and being that bit salty! Great for summer!2. When applying make up it generally looks great straight away but can look a bit dried out- applying this added more of a glossy look and refreshed my make up.Overall I would definitely recommend this product.,5 out of 5 stars.

If I'm going to the beach, I also bring this along for an added hydrating spritz in summer. It's even more cooling if you store it in the fridge.I like the big bottle for home usage, the mini bottles are good for 'travel'. I didn't necessarily see any reduction in 'redness', however my usage of this product is primarily to 'refresh' the face and skin. I recommend this product for everyone of all ages.",5 out of 5 stars.

10850,Avene Thermal Spring Water 150ml - Mist for Sensitive skin,Natasha M.,"[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I surprisingly enjoyed trialling Avène’s Thermal Spring Water product. I have never used a mist such as this one before and found it very convenient on the go, especially after a run or exercising. It immediately soothes irritation and softens skin. The spray bottle is so convenient to use and I didn’t actually find the need to pat dry after a few minutes as it easily absorbed into skin. It can also be used throughout the day over makeup and doesn’t let it slide away. Would overall recommend this product.",5 out of 5 stars.
10851,Avene Thermal Spring Water 150ml - Mist for Sensitive skin,Susan H.,I am truly in love with this product! I use it everyday after I put on face makeup and throughout the day to refresh myself.

10853,Avene Thermal Spring Water 150ml - Mist for Sensitive skin,Anonymous,I first received this spray in a Fab Fit Fun box and I instantly fell in love. I spray this on my face and neck when I need a refresher throughout the day and after I wash my face. We have really hard water in Indianapolis so I love to be able to put good water on my face right after washing. I definitely notice a better complexion as a result when I use Avène Thermal Spring Water!! This is definitely a new must-have in my daily routine.,5 out of 5 stars.
10854,Avene Thermal Spring Water 150ml - Mist for Sensitive skin,Andrea D.,"This is one of my must-have products. I have oily and sensitive skin that can flare up due to allergens in the air. Spritzing this on instantly calms my skin and is very soothing. I use this primarily as a toner after cleanser and before applying serum. I find this helps to prevent any flare ups, especially in spring during hayfever season. This is also great for travel and in the office when the air is quite dry. A single pump really helps to inject moisture back into the skin. The spray is a very fine mist that distributes evenly without dripping. I have a large can in the bathroom and the smaller travel-sized version in my bag. It might seem odd paying for water, but I find this really does have the soothing benefits and worth the money.",5 out of 5 stars.
10855,Avene Thermal Spring Water 150ml - Mist for Sensitive skin,Anonymous,"I have to say I was skeptical about this water in a can, but after using it, I'm now hooked! I love it.

10886,Avene Thermal Spring Water 150ml - Mist for Sensitive skin,Katherine W.,"First, let me say that if you are looking for magic - it doesn’t exist. However, this product has lightened the dark circles under my eyes. While it’s no miracle, this makes my eyes a little brighter so that I can use a little less makeup. That’s a win for me.",4 out of 5 stars.

10888,Avene Thermal Spring Water 150ml - Mist for Sensitive skin,Tina B.,I love the refreshing feel of the spring water after a night of retinal use. I use it also right after I get out of the shower almost as sealant of moisture on my face.,4 out of 5 stars.

My only disappointment is the cap doesn’t stay on! So o won’t be able to put it in my bag and take it with me during the day. So the product is great, the top is defective.",4 out of 5 stars.

10894,Avene Thermal Spring Water 150ml - Mist for Sensitive skin,Leonie C.,"I've been using this Thermal Spring Water for about a year now and love how refreshing it makes my skin feel, especially during those hot, sticky summer days.  The mist is so fine and only a short spritz or two is needed to cover my face.  I use the spray after showering each day and before applying my skincare products, and I find it fabulous for cooling down my face after a workout.  It has in the past relieved and healed the redness on my face after experiencing a reaction to some product I had used.  During the warmer months I use the spray at any time to refresh my skin.  I suppose it's just water in a can with added benefits but no matter what it is it is certainly soothing and comforting and makes my skin feel so refreshed.",4 out of 5 stars.
10895,Avene Thermal Spring Water 150ml - Mist for Sensitive skin,Lauren C.,"I am not 100% sold on this product yet. I use other Avene products which have the thermal spring water included, so I am sure it has a huge benefit there. But in addition, I am just uncertain. I do absolutely love the refreshing feeling it provides, but I have not noticed any huge changes.",4 out of 5 stars.

10898,Avene Thermal Spring Water 150ml - Mist for Sensitive skin,wendy m.,I brought this to spray on my face due having acne that was always angry looking. I sprayed it on my face everyday first thing in the morning and in a few days the acne wasnt as red and they looked better. I felt it made my face feel overall alot better and fresher. I have been using it every day since and feel my face feels and looks alot better. Its good also that my face never stings when I spray it on. So it would be good for peoples faces that are sensitive. Avene Thermal Spring water has become a product that I use in my beauty regime everyday and I couldnt be more impressed,4 out of 5 stars.
10899,Avene Thermal Spring Water 150ml - Mist for Sensitive skin,Vivien L.,[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I think this is a very cooling spray. especially when you are extremely dehydrated.

10900,Avene Thermal Spring Water 150ml - Mist for Sensitive skin,Mara L.,[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] This product was so refreshing for the skin - I took it on a picnic and to the beach and it cooled down my skin so much. It didn't take off my sunscreen and at the end of the day my skin felt nourished and hydrated. Highly recommend!,4 out of 5 stars.
10901,Avene Thermal Spring Water 150ml - Mist for Sensitive skin,Eloise M.,[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Refreshing and hydrating all in one relaxing mist. I've been using the thermal water in the morning before and after I work out for hydration and a little freshen up. My skin feels plump and looks dewy and fresh even after I've just rolled out of bed. I always carry the mini bottle in my handbag whenever I travel as it gives your skin that little boost it needs! I didn't see any insane effects in the texture of my skin but I still absolutely love this product for refreshing and plumping up my skin during the day. I'm so excited for summer to roll around so I can get even more use out of this mist during humid days!,4 out of 5 stars.
10902,Avene Thermal Spring Water 150ml - Mist for Sensitive skin,Bridget L.,"[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] The Avene Thermal Sping Water Spray is perfect for summer! It's nice and cool on the skin and super refreshing. My face feels hydrated after, but isn't sticky at all. The spray has a good pressure, is easy to control and is not overpowering. Although this product is great, I haven't noticed any differences, nor has there hasn't been any visible changes to my skin. The price of the product is reasonable, and I would purchase it again for the summer!",4 out of 5 stars.
10903,Avene Thermal Spring Water 150ml - Mist for Sensitive skin,Lily S.,[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Lovely product that I use over the cooler months. I have this on my desk and use it all day long. The mist is fine and the nozzle sprays  well. I'm not sure if it actually does anything for my skin though? It would be difficult to see visible results. I also like to use it before I apply oil so my face is slightly damp. I mainly use it to cool down. But I don't think I would use this purely for skin care benefits,4 out of 5 stars.
10904,Avene Thermal Spring Water 150ml - Mist for Sensitive skin,Shiren J.,"[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] This is a refreshing moisture boost, and very convenient to use. I use it through the day, after I have a cleaned my face and it does the job for me. Really good to use after you have come in from the sun! Its cooling and refreshing. It takes a while to evaporate from the skin, but one can get around that by not spraying on too much. I have combination skin that is prone to rashes. I find this product moisturizing and soothing.",4 out of 5 stars.
10905,Avene Thermal Spring Water 150ml - Mist for Sensitive skin,Silvia B.,"The moisturizer 's consistency is good, but something did not agree with my skin that the product never soaked into my skin , I need something more occlusive to avoid transepidermal water loss if I put too much of my face was super greasy several hours later.I had too stop using it eventually.",4 out of 5 stars.
10906,Avene Thermal Spring Water 150ml - Mist for Sensitive skin,Erin A.,"This is a really nice step after cleansing and before the rest of my skincare routine, or if I need a little mid-day hydration. I also really enjoy this after using chemical exfoliants to relax my skin.",4 out of 5 stars.

10908,Avene Thermal Spring Water 150ml - Mist for Sensitive skin,Sabrina S.,"I loved the idea of this spring water because I love anything that feels luxurious to use.
