44,Avene DermAbsolu Youth Eye Cream 15ml - Anti-ageing Eye Cream,"Avène DermAbsolu Youth Eye Cream helps the skin to visibly combat the signs of ageing thanks to the unique combination of key ingredients. Puffiness, dark circles and appearance of wrinkles are reduced leaving the eye contour area smoothed and visibly lifted.  Avène DermAbsolu Youth Eye Cream helps the skin to visibly combat the signs of ageing thanks to the unique combination of active ingredients: 
-	Vanilla Polyphenols: Hyaluronic Acid protectors, visibly give back substance and firm the skin, antioxidant 
-	SytenolTM: helps protect against collagen depletion, visibly lifts, tones and reshapes the contours of the face 
-	Glycoleol: Essential skin lipid precursor, intensely nourishes the skin
This combination guarantees unprecedented benefits; visibly lifting, firming and restoring comfort to the skin.

Our hero ingredient, SytenolTM also known by its chemical name ""Bakuchiol"", is extracted from the leaves of the Babchi plant (Psoralea corylifolia) used in Ayurvedic & Chinese medicine for its antibacterial, antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties. Bakuchiol is also used in cosmetic for its anti-ageing properties and is the first natural alternative to retinol. Bakuchiol is photostable meaning that it can be used during the day and is well tolerated on sensitive skin.

The cooling metal applicator tip glides over the delicate skin, gently massaging and decongesting the eye contour. Puffiness, dark circles and appearance of wrinkles are reduced leaving the eye contour area smoothed and visibly lifted. Specially developed for local application, the cream combines a high concentration of non-drying fixing agents (waxes) and an extensive hydra-nourishing phase.

Apply in the morning and/or evening, gently gliding the contoured applicator back and forth along the eye contour and brow bone.
