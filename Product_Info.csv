L'Oreal Paris Revitalift Laser Pure Retinol Night Serum 30ml,"The NEW Revitalift Laser Pure Retinol Night Serum is the highest concentration of Pure Retinol from L'Oréal PARIS, scientifically proven to visibly reduce 100% of wrinkles, even deep ones*  The New L'Oréal Paris Revitalift Laser Pure Retinol Night Serum is our most potent, highest concentration of pure Retinol. Validated with dermatologists, the powerful formula is scientifically proven to visibly reduce 100% of wrinkles, even deep ones*  Known to be highly effective and fast-acting in correcting deep wrinkles and signs of ageing, pure Retinol is a top dermatologist-recommended ingredient which helps to renew skin overnight. It is proven to fight stubborn signs of ageing like deep wrinkles, age spots and uneven skin texture.   WHAT IS PURE RETINOL? Dermatologists recommend Pure Retinol because it is the most researched, potent and effective form. With many retinols available in skincare, always look for those that say PURE. 0.2% Pure Retinol is an optimal concentration that has been dermatologist-validated for fast, visible results.   WHY CHOSE PURE RETINOL? Not all PURE Retinols are created equally. As an ingredient, Pure Retinol is known to degrade and lose potency when exposed to air and light, causing it to be less effective over time - in fact, many products lose significant Retinol concentration before even opening the bottle. Which is why L'Oreal Paris's exclusive international patent-pending technology, RETINOL GUARD ™, has been developed to stabilise and protect the Retinol, so it is potent & effective from the first to the very last drop.  When using Retinol, remember to always use a facial sunscreen or broad spectrum SPF moisturiser as Retinol sensitises your skin to UV rays.  Your skin will need time to get used to this powerful ingredient too, so it is recommended to introduce it gradually and use only at night. *Cosmeto-clinical study on 49 women: scoring of face wrinkles at 4 months.
